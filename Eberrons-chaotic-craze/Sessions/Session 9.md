# Arnolds Stadthaus:
_**Vines.**_ A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-detect-magic) spell reveals a dim aura of transmutation magic around each pumpkin. As an action, a character can carve open a pumpkin to reveal six servings of seeds within. Any creature that eats a serving of pumpkin seeds as an action regains 1 hit point. If a creature eats more than five servings of pumpkin seeds in 1 hour, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) for 1d4 hours.

### W5. Dining Room

The walls are covered with crude drawings in blood that depict boars chasing stick-figure humanoids. A fireplace dominates the south side of the room, and a smashed wooden dining table lies in a heap in the eastern half of the room, surrounded by six broken chairs.

If the characters met the shapechanged [anchorite of Talos](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/338584-anchorite-of-talos) on the way to the loggers’ camp and let it get away (see “[A Boar-ing Encounter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip/loggers-camp#ABoaringEncounter)”), small twig figures rest on the mantelpiece — one representing each party member (including sidekicks). These are [twig blights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17095-twig-blight) that attack if they are touched or harmed.

_**Treasure.**_ Amid the ruined furnishings is a tarnished silver candelabrum worth 25 gp.
