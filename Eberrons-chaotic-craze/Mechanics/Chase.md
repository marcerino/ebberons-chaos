The rules for movement in combat don't translate to every situation. In particular, they can make a potentially thrilling chase seem dull and predictable. Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while creatures with the same Speed never close the distance between each other. Use the following rules to introduce random elements that make chases more exciting.

Know the capabilities of the characters in your party before you make a chase an important feature of an adventure. A character with a high Speed or the right spell (such as [Dimension Door](http://127.0.0.1:5050/spells.html#dimension%20door_xphb), [Fly](http://127.0.0.1:5050/spells.html#fly_xphb), or [Hold Monster](http://127.0.0.1:5050/spells.html#hold%20monster_xphb)) can often end a chase before it begins.

## Beginning a Chasep52

A chase requires at least one quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in [Initiative](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#initiative_xphb) order must roll Initiative as the chase begins. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn.

When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track the distance between them, and designate the pursuer closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.

## Running the Chasep52

Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to take the [Dash](http://127.0.0.1:5050/actions.html#dash_xphb) action every round. Pursuers who stop to cast spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their quarry, and a quarry that doesn't take the Dash action is likely to be caught.

### Dashingp52

A chase participant can take the [Dash](http://127.0.0.1:5050/actions.html#dash_xphb) action a number of times equal to 3 plus its Constitution modifier (minimum of once). Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn or gain 1 [Exhaustion](http://127.0.0.1:5050/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_xphb) level. A participant drops out of the chase if it has 5 [Exhaustion](http://127.0.0.1:5050/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_xphb) levels. A creature can remove the [Exhaustion](http://127.0.0.1:5050/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_xphb) levels it gained during the chase by finishing a [Short](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#short%20rest_xphb) or [Long Rest](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#long%20rest_xphb).

### Spells and Attacksp52

A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range.

Chase participants can't normally make [Opportunity Attacks](http://127.0.0.1:5050/actions.html#opportunity%20attack_xphb) against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, participants can still be the targets of [Opportunity Attacks](http://127.0.0.1:5050/actions.html#opportunity%20attack_xphb) from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, adventurers who chase a thief past a gang of ruffians might provoke [Opportunity Attacks](http://127.0.0.1:5050/actions.html#opportunity%20attack_xphb) from the ruffians.

## Ending a Chasep53

A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when each quarry escapes, or when the pursuers are close enough to their quarry to catch it.

If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check on Initiative count 0 each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, compare the check's total to the [Passive Perception](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#passive%20perception_xphb) scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make the check separately, so it's possible for one quarry to escape while others remain in the chase.

The quarry can gain [Advantage](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#advantage_xphb) or [Disadvantage](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#disadvantage_xphb) on its check based on the circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table.

Escape Factors
|Factor|Check Has...|
|---|---|
|Many things to hide behind|Advantage|
|A very crowded area|Advantage|
|Few things to hide behind|Disadvantage|
|An uncrowded area|Disadvantage|

Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with a [Faerie Fire](http://127.0.0.1:5050/spells.html#faerie%20fire_xphb) spell cast on it might have Disadvantage on checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot.

If the total of the quarry's check is greater than the highest [Passive Perception](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#passive%20perception_xphb) score of the pursuers, the quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues for another round. Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has outpaced its pursuers. For example, in a city, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to where it went.

### Designing Your Own Chase Tablesp53

Unusual environments might suggest unique chase tables. A chase through the sewers of the Free City of Greyhawk or through the spiderweb-filled alleys of [Menzoberranzan](http://127.0.0.1:5050/book.html#XDMG,8,menzoberranzan,0) (a subterranean city teeming with spiders and worshipers of [Lolth](http://127.0.0.1:5050/book.html#XDMG,5,layer%2066%3a%20the%20demonweb,0)) might inspire you to create your own tables.

## Splitting Upp53

Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase separately. You can keep all the creatures in Initiative order, but track the distances separately for each group.

## Role Reversalp53

During a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention from other members of the thieves' guild. As they pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves pursuing them. Roll Initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. Alternatively, the fleeing thief might run into his accomplices. The outnumbered characters might then flee with the thieves in pursuit.

## Mapping the Chasep53

When you plan a chase, draw a rough map that shows the route. Insert obstacles and complications at specific points, especially ones that require the characters to make ability checks or saving throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use the random tables of complications in the "[Chase Complications](http://127.0.0.1:5050/book.html#XDMG,2,chase%20complications,0)" section to choose obstacles that occur at specific points.

Complications can be barriers to progress or opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased through a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw rocks at it to enrage the wasps within, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers.

A map of a chase can be linear or have many branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) branches, while a sewer chase might have several.

## Chase Complicationsp53

Unexpected complications make a chase more exciting. The accompanying Urban Chase Complications table and Wilderness Chase Complications table provide several examples. Each participant in the chase rolls 1d12 at the end of its turn. Consult the appropriate table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in the Initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die.

Characters can create their own complications to shake off pursuers or slow their quarry (for example, casting the [Web](http://127.0.0.1:5050/spells.html#web_xphb) spell in a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these at your discretion.

Urban Chase Complications
|1d12|Complication|
|---|---|
|1|A cart or another large obstacle blocks your way. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to get past the obstacle. On a failed save, the obstacle counts as 10 feet of [Difficult Terrain](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#difficult%20terrain_xphb) for you.|
|2|A crowd blocks your way. Make a DC 10 Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma saving throw (your choice) to navigate through the crowd. On a failed save, the crowd counts as 10 feet of [Difficult Terrain](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#difficult%20terrain_xphb) for you.|
|3|A maze of barrels, crates, or similar obstacles stands in your way. Make a DC 10 Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (your choice) to navigate the maze. On a failed save, the maze counts as 10 feet of [Difficult Terrain](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#difficult%20terrain_xphb) for you.|
|4|The ground is slippery with rain, spilled oil, or some other liquid. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you have the [Prone](http://127.0.0.1:5050/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_xphb) condition.|
|5|You encounter a brawl in progress. Make a DC 15 Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma saving throw (your choice) to get past the brawlers unimpeded. On a failed save, you take 2d4 Bludgeoning damage, and the brawlers count as 10 feet of [Difficult Terrain](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#difficult%20terrain_xphb) for you.|
|6|You must make a sharp turn to avoid colliding with something impassable. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the turn. On a failed save, you collide with something hard and take 1d4 Bludgeoning damage.|
|7-12|There is no complication.|

Wilderness Chase Complications
|1d12|Complication|
|---|---|
|1|You pass through a [Swarm of Insects](http://127.0.0.1:5050/bestiary.html#swarm%20of%20insects_xmm) (see the [Monster Manual](http://127.0.0.1:5050/book.html#XMM), with the DM choosing whichever kind of insects makes the most sense). The swarm uses one of its actions, targeting you.|
|2|A stream or ravine blocks your path. Make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (your choice) to cross the impediment. On a failed save, the impediment counts as 10 feet of [Difficult Terrain](http://127.0.0.1:5050/variantrules.html#difficult%20terrain_xphb) for you.|
|3|Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, blowing sand, dirt, ash, snow, or pollen causes you to have the [Blinded](http://127.0.0.1:5050/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_xphb) condition until the end of your turn. While you are Blinded in this way, your Speed is halved.|
|4|A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On a failed save, you fall 10 feet.|
|5|Your path takes you near a patch of [razorvine](http://127.0.0.1:5050/book.html#XDMG,2,razorvine,0) (see "[Hazards](http://127.0.0.1:5050/book.html#XDMG,2,hazards,0)" in this chapter). Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or use 10 feet of movement (your choice) to avoid the razorvine. On a failed save, you take 1d10 Slashing damage.|
|6|A creature native to the area notices you. (The DM chooses a creature appropriate for the terrain.) Make a DC 10 Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the creature joins the chase, with you as its quarry.|
|7-12|There is no complication.|
