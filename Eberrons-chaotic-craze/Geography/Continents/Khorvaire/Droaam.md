Droaam is a nation of monsters ruled by the Daughters of Sora Kell. Each of these three hags is a legend in her own right, the subjects of tales used to frighten children. Eleven years ago, they seized the lands west of the Graywall Mountains and founded the nation of Droaam.

Although Breland laid claim to these barren lands, Galifar had never tamed this wild region. Gnolls, orcs, and goblins commonly sought haven here, as well as ogres, trolls, harpies, minotaurs, medusas, tieflings, changelings, lycanthropes, and other races unwelcome in civilized lands. In the past, these creatures fought one another more often than they raided human settlements. Under the leadership of the Daughters of Sora Kell, they have new purpose. The Daughters use an army of ogres and war trolls to maintain order.

To date, the other nations of Khorvaire have refused to recognize Droaam, and the region was not acknowledged in the Treaty of Thronehold. Most people believe that the monstrous nation can't last—that even the Daughters can't hold the disparate alliance together—but Droaam is currently thriving and stronger than ever.

Droaam works closely with House Tharashk, selling the services of monstrous soldiers and laborers and byeshk ore, a form of metal with magical properties. Beyond that, it's a still-expanding frontier nation. The cities of Graywall and Great Crag grow larger and more organized every day, and the rest of Khorvaire is uneasy with the potential power of a fully realized Droaam.

The monsters that inhabit Droaam retain their racial subcultures. Most worship the Dark Six, but other religious traditions flourish as well.

## Interesting Things About Droaam p114

- Droaam uses the supernatural abilities of its citizens as tools, just as other nations of Khorvaire use magic. The Daughters of Sora Kell keep their people fed with troll sausage and use harpy's song to quell brawls. When dealing with monsters in Droaam, consider the practical applications of their abilities.
- When the Church of the Silver Flame purged lycanthropy from the Five Nations, a number of lycanthropes escaped into the region that later become Droaam. The Dark Pack alliance of lycanthropes, worgs, and other supernatural predators hunts southern Droaam.

## Droaamite Characters p114

Minotaurs, orcs, gnolls, tieflings, changelings, and other monstrous species all have a place in Droaam. Consider these questions when making a Droaamite character:

**What Makes You Different?** The people of Droaam aren't just humans with horns or green skin. Think about the unique aspects of your people and what makes you different from humanity, both physically and culturally.

**What Are Your Ambitions?** Citizens of Droaam are proud of their nation. You know that the rest of Khorvaire considers you a monster. Do you intend to prove that you and your kind are capable of deeds humanity can't imagine? Or are you driven solely by your personal desires, or the goals of your family or warlord?

**How Does Your Background Shape You?** The diverse creatures of Droaam could include a kobold city-savvy rogue urchin, an orc outlander barbarian with little knowledge of the outside world, or a tiefling warlock sage versed in Arcana and History.

## Cities and Sites p114

In the past, particular creatures dominated the communities of Droaam. The harpy flights lived in mountain peaks, while the medusas remained isolated in the citadel of Cazhaak Draal. Under the rule of the Daughters of Sora Kell, the Droaamites are creating cities where all manner of creatures live and work together.

### Graywall p114

Known as the Gateway to Droaam, this city sits on the border to Breland. Though dominated by monsters and ruled by a mind flayer, Graywall is both a center for trade and a haven for deserters and fugitives. The dragonmarked houses maintain outposts in Graywall, and House Tharashk governs the Calabas, the foreign quarter inhabited by humans and other people from elsewhere in Khorvaire.

### The Great Crag p114

Built atop ancient goblin ruins, the Crag is the seat of the [[Daughters of Sora Kell]]. Few outsiders have seen this thriving city of monsters. Of the dragonmarked houses, only House Tharashk has a presence in the city.

### The Venomous Demesne p114

This hidden city is ruled by families of [[tiefling]] warlocks who wield powerful magic and craft dark wonders. If you're playing a tiefling or a warlock, you could have ties to the Venomous Demesne.

## Aftermath of the Last War p114

Droaam is barely a decade old. The treaty nations refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty; according to the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, it's a rebellious territory of Breland. As a renegade nation, it is a haven for war criminals and deserters, as well as brigands and mages pursuing forbidden paths of magic. The monsters of Droaam have no particular love for these bandits and fugitives, and outlanders have to watch their step.

Tensions remain high on the border with Breland, resulting in constant skirmishes and raids. Deeper within the nation, the Daughters of Sora Kell build their power. Graywall and the Great Crag are constantly expanding, with goblins and ogres laboring through the night. Warlords drill their troops, forcing all manner of monsters to work together. A predatory aspect permeates life in Droaam but also a sense of excitement, the belief that the Daughters will lead Droaam to greatness. For centuries the people of Droaam have hidden in the shadows; now they stand in the light, and they are proud.

#### The Korranberg Chronicle—Descent into Droaam: my trail to terror

p114

_We're all going to die._ That thought echoed through my mind as the wagon carried us toward the Great Crag. The diplomats around me intended to speak with the Daughters of Sora Kell. All I could think about was the stories my grandmother used to tell me. _Sora Maenya can crush a giant with her bare hands. She can eat the whole creature and still be hungry. If you're bad, she'll come in the night and carry you away. She'll make a lantern of your skull and torment you until the end of time._ And she's the _least_ frightening member of the Daughters of Sora Kell!

When I could set aside my sheer terror, I was learning a great deal about this strange nation. The Daughters invested power in warlords, each of whom rules a territory in their name. It's sort of like Karrnath, except each of the warlords of Droaam is a horrifying monster. We were traveling through the territory of the Prince of Bones, an ancient troll said to be too evil to die. We'd already passed through the domain of Queen Sheska the medusa, where even the trees are turning to stone. Harpies. Gargoyles. There's even a king of the kobolds. Our caravan was being protected by gnolls. Not protected _from_ gnolls, protected _by_ gnolls. I thought things couldn't get any stranger. I couldn't have been more wrong....
