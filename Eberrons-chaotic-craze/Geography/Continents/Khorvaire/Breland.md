In the wake of the Last War, Breland is one of the most powerful nations in Khorvaire. Possessing a large population and abundant resources, Breland leads the continent in industry.

The Brelish are known for their pragmatism and independence. They lack the discipline of Karrns and the faith of the Thranes, but they excel at **finding innovative solutions to problems**. The Brelish also have a talent for intrigue and subterfuge. The King's Dark Lanterns is one of the finest intelligence agencies in Khorvaire, rivaled only by House Phiarlan and the Trust of Zilargo. The dark side of these aptitudes is a strong streak of cynicism, which allows crime and corruption to flourish in Brelish cities and temples. The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, but in general the Brelish aren't as devout as citizens of other nations.

King Boranel ir'Wynarn rules Breland in conjunction with an elected parliament. Boranel is a popular leader celebrated for his exploits during the Last War, but his children have yet to prove themselves, and a growing movement advocates for abandoning royal rule when Boranel passes.

## Interesting Things About Breland p107

- Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire. Almost a nation in its own right, the City of Towers is a hub for commerce and intrigue. Chapter 3 provides more information on Sharn.
- The [[Boromar Clan]] is the oldest and most powerful criminal organization in Breland. The Boromar halfling leadership maintains ties to the Talenta Plains. Other notable criminal organizations include the monsters of Daask and House Tarkanan, an alliance of assassins and thieves with aberrant dragonmarks (see [chapter 4](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,11,crime%20in%20sharn,0) for more about these crime syndicates).
- Breland's major cities are highly cosmopolitan. Due to its proximity to Droaam, Breland's cities include more monsters—ogres, orcs, goblins, and even sahuagin, harpies, and gargoyles—than elsewhere in the Five Nations.

## Brelish Characters p107

As you develop a Brelish character or NPC, consider the following qualities:

**Slightly Shady**. Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places. Backgrounds such as criminal, spy, or charlatan can reflect this tendency, regardless of your class. You could also be a folk hero who challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an entertainer who plays in every dive in Sharn.

**Innovative and Independent**. Find your own path in the world; don't simply follow established traditions. As a cleric, you might challenge your church and follow your own divine revelations. As a wizard, you could search for new techniques or attempt to unravel forgotten secrets.

**Practical**. Whether it's about fashion, food, or conversation, the Brelish tend to be pragmatic. Why spend a fortune on a fancy meal when a simple one will do? You use whatever tool gets the job done, and you don't see a need for unnecessary flair.

## Cities and Sites p108

Beyond the magnificence of Sharn, Breland hosts a vast spectrum of other wonders.

### Argonth p108

The floating fortress of Breland, Argonth is one of the marvels of the Last War. The product of House Cannith ingenuity and Brelish industrial might, Argonth is the largest engine of war ever built. This moving city is home to thousands of soldiers. Currently Argonth patrols the edge of the Mournland, but if tensions rise with Droaam or [[Darguun]], the fortress can be deployed to reinforce a threatened border.

As a Brelish soldier or spy, you might have served aboard Argonth for a time before some incident led you to become an adventurer.

### Black Pit p108

A massive chasm in the Blackcap Mountains, the Black Pit is over a mile across and descends beyond the limits of sight. It's said to be an entrance to the abyss of [[Khyber]], and foul creatures live among the caves that honeycomb its walls. A nearby village—also called Black Pit—provides a haven for deserters and other criminals as well as a thriving black market.

If you have shady friends, you've likely heard of Black Pit's reputation as a place to quietly "disappear." Similarly, if you have ties to the King's Dark Lanterns, you know where to find some of Breland's worst criminals.

### New Cyre p108

What began as a refugee camp has evolved into a struggling town hosting thousands of Cyran refugees. Prince Oargev holds court in New Cyre, considering himself a king in exile. Though resources are scarce, New Cyre remains a symbol of hope for many refugees. It's also a last stop for those determined to explore the Mournland.

### Sharn p108

The City of Towers is described in chapter 3. Law and chaos dance on a knife's edge here, one never truly gaining advantage over the other.

### Vathirond p108

Throughout the Last War, this town was beset by armies from Thrane, Cyre, and Karrnath. Vathirond's residents still hold grudges against these close foreign neighbors. However, their attention of late has been focused on the Mournland. Nameless horrors have begun to slip into Breland from the east at an alarming rate, and Brelish soldiers and adventurers stationed in Vathirond are usually the first to contend with these threats.

### Wroat p108

Built on both sides of the Howling River at a point where the river widens, the ancestral seat of the rulers of Breland seduces visitors with its tree-lined avenues, elegant drawbridges, cleanliness, and laid-back atmosphere. Perched on a rocky island in the middle of the river, surrounded by military docks and barracks, is Brokenblade Castle, the king's stern fortress.

In contrast to its welcoming countenance, Wroat casts dark shadows, and much goes on quietly behind closed doors. The absence of beggars and riffraff in the streets might also raise suspicion that Wroat is putting on appearances. The King's Dark Lanterns are ever vigilant here, and newcomers who aim to misbehave tend to disappear quickly and without so much as a whisper.

## Aftermath of the Last War p109

For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and alliances. Breland fought Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane at various points of the war, as well as clashing with Darguun and Droaam. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.

The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including Wroat and Sharn—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of Vathirond is still repairing the damage from Thrane attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.

Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.
#### The Sharn Inquisitive—Winter Palace under siege

p109

Although untouched by a century of war, the Winter Palace suffered an attack from an unexpected quarter: the people of Breland. The so-called Swords of Liberty have taken credit for a daring raid that left the east wing of the palace in flames. No members of the Brelish royal family were in attendance during the attack.

The [[Swords of Liberty]] call for the violent overthrow of the Wynarn monarchy, demanding that all power be invested in the Brelish parliament. Their manifesto draws on the speeches of Lord Ruken ir'Clarn, but Lord Ruken has condemned their action. "No victory is possible when Brelish fight Brelish," he said in Wroat. "But I hope King Boranel can see that the time for change is upon us and help us navigate a peaceful transition of power before any more innocents are hurt."
