In a nation of storms and long winters, the grim and stoic Karrns are accustomed to enduring hardship without complaint.

First and foremost, Karrnath is known for its military tradition. Strength, strategy, and discipline are the core values of Karrnath. **Karrnath's soldiers might be the finest in Khorvaire, but they lack the magical support of Aundair or Thrane, which evened the odds** during the Last War. Nonetheless, Karrns are proud of their martial history, and most are convinced that they would have eventually won the Last War.

Karrnath suffered a series of severe food shortages and plagues early in the Last War. As a result, the king embraced the Blood of Vol as the national religion. **The priests of this faith bolstered Karrnath's forces with undead.** The current king, Kaius ir'Wynarn III, broke ties with the Blood of Vol and has stopped creating new undead, but Karrnath still has a significant number of skeletons and zombies in service. Many Karrns still believe in the Blood of Vol and approve of the use of undead, but just as many feel that this practice disgraces Karrnath's proud military history and that the necromancers might have been responsible for the famines and plagues.

## Interesting Things About Karrnath p117

- Rekkenmark Academy is the premier military institute in Khorvaire; prior to the Last War, all of Galifar's officers trained at Rekkenmark.
- The Sovereign Host has regained its place as the dominant religion of Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol retains a strong following. Communities that practice the faith still use skeletons and zombies as guards or laborers.
- The laws of Karrnath are harsher than those in other treaty nations, approaching a state of martial law.

## Karrnathi Characters p117

Karrns are somber folk and disapprove of extravagance or excessive shows of emotion. As you develop a Karrnathi character or NPC, consider the following:

**Military Service**. Karrns have a strong tradition of military service, making soldier or sailor appropriate backgrounds for any character. Criminals and charlatans have a difficult time evading the harsh laws of Karrnath. The [Martial Adept](https://5e.tools/feats.html#martial%20adept_phb) feat can give a character a strong sense of military experience.

**Martial Tradition**. Karrnathi tradition emphasizes teamwork, focus, and force, and melee warriors prefer heavy armor and weapons. Fighters favor the Champion and Battle Master martial archetypes, and Karrnathi wizards choose the School of Evocation or Necromancy as their arcane tradition.

**The Dead**. Undead soldiers have served in Karrnath's armies for decades. How do you feel about the undead? Are you a follower of the Blood of Vol who considers the undead to be a practical tool? Do you have a relative or friend currently serving? Or do you despise the Blood of Vol and the use of necromancy?

## Cities and Sites p117

Sturdy walls surround Karrnathi communities, and even the smallest village maintains a capable militia.

### Atur p117

Known as the City of Night, Atur is the stronghold of the Blood of Vol in Karrnath. During the war, this was the center for the production of undead, and massive catacombs below the city hold legions of Karrnath's undead soldiers in case they are needed again.

### Fort Bones p118

Fortresses such as this one dot the hilltops of Karrnath, watching for signs of enemy encroachment even since the Last War has ended. Fort Bones' garrison consists primarily of Karrnathi undead soldiers. No lights glow here, as these undead rely on darkvision to see.

### Karrlakton p118

The turbulent Cyre River separates this city from the deathly Mournland. Karrlakton is the birthplace of kings (both Karrn the Conqueror and Galifar I were born here) and is the center of power for House Deneith. The house's headquarters, Sentinel Tower, dominates the city's skyline. A stern edifice of angular stone, Sentinel Tower radiates martial authority and is one of the most heavily defended fortresses in Khorvaire. Surrounding the tower are training grounds, barracks, and smithies to accommodate all of House Deneith's needs. Sentinel Tower serves as the headquarters of the famed Sentinel Marshals, though most of them are abroad.

### Korth p118

The capital of Karrnath is a city-fortress on the edge of the Nightwood and the seat of King Kaius III. Its walls and towers bristle with the weapons of war, and military marches through the city help bolster the spirits of the Karrns as well as intimidate foreign diplomats. The forges of Korth produce some of the finest armor and weapons in Khorvaire.

### The Nightwood p118

This massive forest has close ties to the Plane of Mabar. Monsters sometimes slip out of the Nightwood to threaten the surrounding regions. Criminals and fugitives who flee into the Nightwood find the dangers within deadlier than any Karrnathi executioner.

## Aftermath of the Last War p118

Karrnath has always been a martial nation, and its people remain vigilant. Early in the war, King Kaius I instituted the Code of Kaius, a strict set of laws and limits. Karrnath weathered a number of famines during the war, and this privation led to an ongoing program of rationing to ensure that the nation is prepared for whatever lies ahead. The war is over, but the Code of Kaius and the rationing remains in place; the people of Karrnath willingly endure ongoing hardship to ensure that their future is secure. The populace frowns on excess of any sort, accepts limits on luxury items, and approves of swift and harsh punishments for crime.

King Kaius III was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold and remains committed to peace. However, many of the nation's warlords believe that Karrnath would have won the Last War and that Kaius denied the Karrnathi people their rightful destiny. Should these warlords gain sufficient support, they could push for a military coup.

A second destabilizing factor is the tension between the followers of the Blood of Vol and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead troops. The traditionalists claim that the dark magic of the Seekers caused famines and plagues, crippling Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the undead. The Blood of Vol could back an uprising in Karrnath, or those who wish to drive out the Seekers could trigger a civil war.

#### The Korranberg Chronicleâ€”In the Thrall of the Vampire King

p117

Kaius ir'Wynarn III emerged from the shadows like a villain in one of Kessler's plays. His guardians kept him hidden during his youth while his aunt Moranna served as the regent of Karrnath. So it was a surprise to many when he burst forth to claim his crown and his power, all the more so because of his uncanny resemblance to Kaius I, the ruler who plunged Karrnath into the Last War and instituted the brutal system of laws that bears his name.

Given the circumstances of Kaius III's ascension, it's hardly surprising that the new king would face challenges from the proud warlords of Karrnath. Some questioned his lineage and his ability to command. But the most unusual challenge came from the warlord Drago Thul: was Kaius III actually alive? Kaius I had elevated the Blood of Vol in Karrnath and instituted the use of undead as weapons of war. Drago Thul asserted that Kaius III was actually Kaius I, a vampiric monster "seeking to drain the lifeblood of Karrnath itself." This was a serious accusation; the undead have no rights under the Code of Galifar and cannot inherit titles or lands. Thul's challenge spread like wildfire, only to be crushed when Kaius III met the warlords under the midday sun and cut his palm to show his freely flowing blood.

This should have been the end of it, but the tale of the Vampire King has proven surprisingly resilient. Some say that the king developed special enchantments to avoid the effects of sunlight; others say that he has relies on changeling impersonators to take his place in the daylight. As for Drago Thul, he refused to stand down when Kaius III pushed for peace and the Treaty of Thronehold. He fled to the city of Stormreach in Xen'drik with a small band of followers, and he continues to rally support against "the monster that sits on our throne."
