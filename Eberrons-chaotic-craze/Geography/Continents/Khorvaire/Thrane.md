The modern [[Church of the Silver Flame]] was founded in Thrane, and most of the people of the nation follow this faith. During the Last War, the people of Thrane chose to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to embrace the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years, Thrane has been a theocracy. The head of the state is 11-year-old Jaela Daran, the divinely selected Keeper of the Flame. Jaela depends on the Council of Cardinals to perform the practical work of running the nation.

The primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent from supernatural evil. The church has always had a militant aspect, with battalions of templars and peasant militias prepared to face undead, lycanthropes, or other monstrous threats. **But compassion and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents**. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.

Not all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.

## Interesting Things About Thrane p127

- Faith is part of daily life in Thrane, and divine adepts provide important services. Magic is also common in Thrane. _Everbright lanterns_ light the streets while magewrights and wizards practice their trades, though there are fewer of them than in other nations.
- Every town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark forces—necromancers, warlocks, and the like—finds Thrane a dangerous, unwelcoming place.
- The feudal system of nobility remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the church. Queen Diani ir'Wynarn is the "blood regent," serving as a symbolic advisor to the Keeper of the Flame. A small fraction of the population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power.

## Thrane Characters p127

As you develop a Thrane character, consider the following details:

**The Impact of Faith.** If you want to reflect a close bond to the Silver Flame, you could gain a few divine spells by taking the Magic Initiate feat. Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you might focus on archery-related combat styles or take the Sharpshooter feat. Any Thrane could take the acolyte background to reflect a strong connection to the church or the soldier background based on service with the templars.

**Church or Crown**? Do you support the theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it and invites corruption.

**Dealing with Darkness**. The Shadow in the Flame can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush all darkness?

## Cities and Sites p127

The Church of the Silver Flame is a militant faith, and Thrane communities are built around fortified churches designed to serve as fortresses in times of trouble. Larger towns maintain sturdy walls patrolled by skilled archers. A Flamic architectural style appears throughout the region. Buildings incorporate light and soaring spaces, and icons of the Silver Flame and images of the martyr Tira Miron appear throughout the nation.

### Flamekeep p127

The spiritual heart and capital of Thrane, Flamekeep is a massive fortress city. The Keeper of the Flame dwells in the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame, which holds the pillar of fire born when Tira Miron sacrificed herself to bind the demon [[Bel Shalor]]. The cathedral is the seat of the Council of Cardinals and the primary garrison of the templar order. Flamekeep is also home to Thalingard, the ancestral palace of the rulers of Thrane and current residence of Queen Diani ir'Wynarn.

### Shadukar p128

Shadukar is a grim reminder of the cost of the war. Once known as the Jewel of the Sound, this coastal city was destroyed in a bitter siege against Karrnathi forces. The city has yet to be reclaimed, and it's said to be haunted both by Thrane ghosts and by undead forces left behind by the Karrns.

### Thaliost p128

An ancient Aundairian city seized during the Last War, Thaliost was ceded to Thrane under the Treaty of Thronehold. Many of its people bitterly oppose the Thrane occupation, but it's also become a haven for Aundairian followers of the extremist Pure Flame sect; violence often breaks out between these two factions.

## Aftermath of the Last War p128

The war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane and its neighbors. Aundairian war magic created a blasted wasteland between the two nations. To the east, the conflict with Karrnath left farms and cities such as Shadukar devastated and abandoned, home only to the lingering undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.

For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The Silver Flame urges people to stand together in the face of evil, and across the nation, villagers work together to repair the damage inflicted during the war. People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.

The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath for its use of undead soldiers, and many Thranes are quick to imagine all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise, Thranes have bitter memories of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch knights receive a cold reception.

For most Thranes, the war strengthened their faith and drew them together. However, some question the validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found even among the most devout followers of the faith; such people fear that the merging of temporal and spiritual authority distracts the church from its proper mission. If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore Queen Diani to power.

Thaliost is another open wound. The Council of Cardinals is determined to hold onto this prize, but it is a bitter point of contention with Aundair and a constant source of tension and violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you support Thrane's rule?

#### The Sharn Inquisitive—I was scorched by the Silver Flame!

p126

Growing up on the streets of the Callestan district in Sharn, I learned not to put my faith in anything I couldn't see or hold. I think that's why my editor sent me to Flamekeep to cover the Ascension; surely I'd see clearly, with eyes untouched by faith. I thought so, too. But then I found myself in the Chamber of Tira's Sacrifice, a pillar of silver fire marking the spot where one woman gave her life to protect countless innocents. I saw people from all nations joined together in song, celebrating both that ancient sacrifice and the end of our current war. And looking into the innocent eyes of the child priestess, I truly heard the words of that song for the first time: a call for all of us to be better than we are, to protect those in need, to remember that we are all one people in the light of the Silver Flame.
