Fertile farmlands surround the grand cities of Aundair. The floating towers of Arcanix are the finest institute for mystical study in Khorvaire, and magic is deeply ingrained in Aundairian culture. The nation produces more magewrights and wandslingers than any other in Khorvaire.

From the nobles lounging in the towers of Fairhaven to the common folk working the vast vineyards of Bluevine, Aundairians value wit and wisdom. Aundairians prefer finesse to brute force and appreciate cunning wordplay and fine fashions. The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of Aundair, with a particular devotion to Aureon. However, the Silver Flame also maintains a devoted following—some might say overzealous.

Although Aundair is a small nation, its arcane superiority allowed it retain its dominion during the Last War. The people of Aundair know that knowledge is power, and they take pride in their nation's magical advancements. To ensure her nation's prosperity and dominance, Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn instituted the Arcane Initiative, an aggressive series of programs intended to forward the development of mystical infrastructure and battle magic.

## Interesting Things About Aundair p103

- [[Arcanix]] is the most prestigious academy of magic in Khorvaire. Most of its sages specialize in ritual magic and abstract theory, and don't have the full powers of wizards.
- Magic permeates many aspects of Aundairian life—more so than other nations. A [cleansing stone](https://5e.tools/items.html#cleansing%20stone_erlw) (see [chapter 5](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12)) graces every village, and you might encounter animated farming equipment in the fields. The Knights Arcane are an elite unit of eldritch knights, and the spies of the Royal Eyes of Aundair specialize in divination magic.
- Some Aundairian nobles are bound by arcane pacts handed down through generations. Only remarkable heirs—such as player characters—develop into warlocks. Most such lines have an Archfey patron.

Regardless of your Intelligence score, as an Aundairian you're sure you're the smartest person in the room. Consider the following characteristics for your Aundairian:

**Arcane Talent**. If you're not going to play a magic-using class, consider creating a high elf or a human with the Magic Initiate feat. Whether you favor damage-dealing cantrips or more utilitarian ones, every Aundairian should know a little magic.

**Magic Beats Mundane**. Why use your hand when you could use [mage hand](https://5e.tools/spells.html#mage%20hand_phb)? Why strain your muscles tugging on a bowstring when you could use a wand?

**Show Some Style**. Don't settle for common clothes and a squalid meal when you could wear [glamerweave](https://5e.tools/items.html#glamerweave_erlw) (see [chapter 5](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12)) and drink the finest wine. If you're a fighter, focus on finesse instead of crude strength. And never miss an opportunity for a clever quip.

## Cities and Sites 
Aundair intersperses pastoral farmlands between densely populated cities.

### Arcanix p106

This farming village on Lake Galifar provides food for the nearby floating towers of wizardry that serve as home to Aundair's Arcane Congress—a cutting-edge research facility and the finest school of magic in Khorvaire. The members of the congress oversee the magical research conducted in these towers, advise Aundair's queen on all things magical, and confer with colleagues visiting from other nations.

Apprentices come from all over Khorvaire to train at Arcanix. If you're a wizard, sage, or artificer, you might have learned your craft here.

### Fairhaven p106

The capital of Aundair is one of the most beautiful cities in Eberron. Stunning displays of magical light and other arcane wonders enhance the exquisite architecture. This is the seat of the University of Wynarn, a prestigious institution that draws students from across Khorvaire. As a noble, entertainer, or sage, you might have your roots in the City of Lights.
### Passage p106

Located on the shores of Lake Galifar, the city of Passage is the heart of the dragonmarked House Orien. Resources include production and maintenance facilities for the lightning rail and the Orien caravans. If you have the Mark of Passage, odds are good you've spent time here.

### Stormhome p106

This island city is the seat of House Lyrandar, and Queen Aurala allows the house a free rein in governing the isle. It is the finest resort and vacation spot in Khorvaire. Spies, charlatans, sailors, and house agents all have a place in Stormhome. Even though the island escaped the devastation wrought during the Last War, it remains a hotbed for clandestine activities.

Lyrandar wizards use magic to continuously alter Stormhome's weather, turning the otherwise bleak and storm-blasted location into a temperate island getaway.

## Aftermath of the Last War p106

Aundair and Thrane were bitter rivals during the Last War. Thrane seized the ancient city of Thaliost during the war and holds it to this day. Most of the people of Aundair remain furious about the occupation of Thaliost, but the city has become a haven for Aundairians who revere the Silver Flame.

The Eldeen Reaches seceded from Aundair halfway through the Last War. The western farmers rebelled over high taxes and neglect, allying with the druids of the Towering Wood. Aundair was forced to accept the sovereignty of the Reaches under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, but many Aundairians view it as a renegade nation.

Extensive use of magic has repaired most of the damage to the cities of Aundair, but the countryside remains scarred by the war, especially along the border with Thrane. The Crying Fields are a region of farmlands permanently scarred by magic and haunted by restless spirits. Aundairians claim their nation is stronger than ever, but some worry about the long-term impact of the loss of the Eldeen farmlands and the Crying Fields.

Now, Aundairians debate over differing views of their nation's future. Some believe the first focus should be reuniting Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force. Others consider Thaliost to be the pressing issue. And still others support Queen Aurala's claim to the throne of Galifar. When creating an Aundairian, consider whether you have ties to any of the affected regions and if this influences your opinion of Thranes or druids.

#### The Korranberg Chronicle—wizard war brewing at arcanix?

p107

Before the war, the [[Arcane Congress]] served all Galifar. The most promising students from across Khorvaire came to study at Arcanix, and students from Khorvaire, Cyre, and Aundair worked together to win honor in the Trials of the Ninefold Path. Known to students simply as the Nine, this contest pits students of the eight traditions against one another in a series of arcane challenges, along with a ninth bracket for those who have yet to select a tradition. Teamwork, independence, memorization, innovation—the Nine challenges competitors on many levels, and the finest wizards of Galifar were invariably champions of the Nine.

Thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, students of all nations once again study side by side in the towers of Arcanix. But no treaty or ritual can easily dispel the tensions of a century of war. Over the last year we've reported on a number of hate crimes in the towers fueled by nationalist passions. Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the diversity that has evolved over the course of the past century—highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, Cyran illusions, and more. But privately, professors fear that the competitive aspect of the Nine will inflame nationalist tension. Some even believe that the lives of foreign students could be endangered should they defeat Aundairian champions.

Only time will tell if the Nine can bring us together as it once did, or if it will drive us further apart.
