A stretch of fertile farmlands borders a vast, untamed forest. Farmers tend the fields, while tribes of shifters and circles of druids and rangers roam through the woods. These are the Eldeen Reaches.

Druids and shifters dwelled in the Towering Wood for thousands of years, but the eastern farmlands of the Reaches were part of Aundair until the Last War. The lords of Aundair focused their resources on the war effort, ignoring banditry and other problems faced by the farmers of the east. The Wardens of the Wood—largest of the druid sects—came to the aid of these farmers. Fifty years ago, the people of eastern Aundair seceded and formed the Eldeen Reaches. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized the Reaches as a nation, but its citizens fear Aundair will try to reclaim the region.

Druidic magic is central to life in the Eldeen Reaches. Its people seek to live in harmony with the natural world, and each community has a druidic advisor who helps with planning and planting. The Towering Wood is also home to tribes of shifters, who maintain a nomadic existence. The Wardens of the Wood uphold order and settle disputes, and the Great Druid Oalian—an awakened greatpine—is the spiritual leader of the Reaches.

## Interesting Things About the Eldeen Reaches p115

- The Towering Wood is vast and untamed. The Wardens of the Wood seek to protect travelers, but swathes of forest remain entirely untouched by human or shifter. Such areas could hold giant beasts never seen in the outside world, or relics from a previous age—artifacts or ruins created by demons or the terrifying daelkyr.
- The fey have a strong presence in the Towering Wood. Even outside the fey stronghold of the Twilight Demesne, manifest zones tied to Thelanis (see [chapter 4](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,5,eldeen%20reaches,0)) allow passage between worlds. The Eldeen Reaches are a logical origin for a character with ties to the fey.
- Druidic magic is a vital tool in the Eldeen Reaches. Residents use animal messengers to carry communications between villages, and beasts perform vital services.

## Eldeen Characters p115

When creating an Eldeen character or NPC, consider the following:

**Farm or Forest**? Did you grow up on one of the farms of the eastern Reaches, or did you spend your childhood in the Towering Wood? Are you comfortable in buildings, or do you prefer the open air? As a child of the forest, you might take the outlander background, or perhaps you became a folk hero by defending farmers from bandits and beasts.

**Natural Magic**. Druidic traditions play an important role in Eldeen society. If you're a druid or ranger, are you a stoic Warden of the Wood or a grim Child of Winter? Even if you're not a spellcaster, the Magic Initiate feat can provide you with a few spells to reflect a basic initiation into the druidic mysteries.

**A Land with No Lords.** The Reachers are fiercely independent. They broke with Aundair, and they bow to no monarch. The folk of the Reaches value talent over titles. The Eldeen people respect the guidance of the druids, but they all work together to solve their problems; no one gives orders to a Reacher.

## Cities and Sites p116

Most people of the Eldeen Reaches live in villages and on farms. Some folk in the Towering Wood make their homes in the vast trees, while others are wanderers.

### The Gloaming p116

This region of the Towering Wood has strong ties to the sinister Plane of Mabar (see [chapter 4](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10)). It's charged with negative energy, and undead and other malevolent creatures lurk in its shadows.

### Greenheart p116

The grove of the Archdruid Oalian, the awakened greatpine, is a place of great primal power. The Wardens of the Wood are based around Greenheart, but all the druid circles of the Eldeen Reaches send emissaries to Greenheart when they have important matters to discuss.

### The Twilight Demesne p116

Located within the Towering Wood, the Twilight Demesne has close ties to the Faerie Court of Thelanis (see [chapter 4](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,10)). Fey abound in this forest, and those who wander within may stumble upon the City of Rose and Thorn, the domain of a powerful archfey called the King of Summer. If you're playing a character with ties to the fey, the Twilight Demesne could be your home.

### Varna p116

The largest city in the Reaches serves as the gateway for commerce with the world beyond. Reacher merchants come from far and wide to sell their goods in the markets of Varna. All the dragonmarked houses have outposts in Varna, but as the ancestral seat of House Vadalis it houses their largest enclave.
