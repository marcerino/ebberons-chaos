Q'barra is a young nation on the edge of Khorvaire, an untamed frontier filled with danger and opportunity. During the golden age of Galifar, few humans bothered to cross the Endworld Mountains to explore the vast jungle beyond. When the Last War broke out, a fleet of settlers came to Q'barra in search of a new home far from the war. As this settlement expanded, the settlers discovered massive deposits of Eberron dragonshards (see [chapter 5](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12)). Over the past decade, a wave of prospectors, wandslingers, refugees, and fortune-seekers have descended on Q'barra, along with brigands, deserters from the war, and all manner of criminals and opportunists.

To their surprise, Q'barra was already home to a number of ancient civilizations humans know nothing about: the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation, the dragonborn of Ka'rhashan, and the confederacy of the Poison Dusk lizardfolk. Most settlers refer to them collectively as "scales." King Sebastes ir'Kesslan of Newthrone has established a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, but communication has been difficult and prospectors rarely abide by the terms of the treaty.

## Interesting Things About Q'barra p122

- Q'barra is one of the richest sources of Eberron dragonshards in Khorvaire, drawing waves of settlers and prospectors to this young and growing nation on the edge of civilization.
- Certain ruins in Q'barra appear connected to the Age of Demons. The settlers know little of the history of this region, but the Poison Dusk lizardfolk have ties to fiendish powers.
- House Tharashk has a strong presence in Q'barra. Tharashk is the primary buyer of Eberron dragonshards and also runs large-scale mining operations here.

## Q'barran Characters p123

Q'barra tempts explorers from the west with the prospects of wealth and new lands to conquer—mostly humans but including members of all races found in Khorvaire. Settlers, dragonborn, and lizardfolk characters who originate here should consider the following:

**Settlers**. Q'barra is an excellent place to explore the traditional archetypes of the classic Western. As a paladin, you could be a lone sheriff seeking to protect your newly formed mining village. Your cleric could be the town preacher. As a sorcerer or bard with a criminal background, you could be a dashing wandslinger looking for trouble and gold.

**Renegades and Regrets**. Q'barra promises a land of opportunity and a place where you can leave your past behind. Are you a deserter? Were you convicted of a crime you didn't commit? Are you fleeing from a broken heart? Q'barra has also drawn Cyran refugees and newly freed warforged, both seeking a home in the wild east.

**Lizardfolk**. The lizardfolk's primitive culture blends druidic traditions with the beliefs of the Silver Flame. You might have been sent to study the softskins—to learn about them and potentially serve as an envoy for your people. Alternatively, you could be following a spiritual vision.

**Dragonborn**. The dragonborn live amid the remnants of ancient glory. They have a proud martial tradition, and a number of dragonborn venture west in search of worthy challenges. If you follow this path, you might have served as a mercenary in the Last War.

## Cities and Sites p123

Q'barra is split into three main regions. New Galifar is the original colony; it has a feudal structure and holds to the laws of the Treaty of Thronehold. To the north, Hope is a collection of small mining towns. In Hope, the law goes only as far as the people willing to enforce it. Beyond these human regions lie the unexplored lands of the scales.
### Haka'torvhak p123
Explorers tell stories of a city hidden deep in the jungles of Q'barra—a wondrous citadel of obsidian and brass. According to these tales, the city is filled with treasure and guarded by a dragon fused with an ancient demon.
### Newthrone p123
The capital of New Galifar and the seat of King Sebastes, Newthrone is the largest city and port in Q'barra. Myriad people from all over Khorvaire mingle here in crowded streets. Soldiers pay little heed to the rampant crime in these streets, viewing it instead as part of life in the port city.
### Wyrmwatch p123
A thriving prospecting town in Hope, Wyrmwatch was established by Cyran refugees. Although far smaller than New Cyre in Breland, its people are proud of what they have built. The independent community is led by Elder Nevillom, a veteran and evangelist of the Silver Flame. Nevillom's courage and passionate sermons help sustain the people of Wyrmwatch in difficult times.
## Aftermath of the Last War p123
The influx of Cyran refugees promises to reshape Q'barra. Most of the settlers are peaceful people searching for a homes and opportunities, but some among them chose Q'barra over refugee camps because they refused to accept charity from former enemies. These "Mourners" rob and kill settlers from the nations that fought against Cyre. Hope also has its share of brigands and criminals, bandits who prey on House Tharashk convoys and settlers alike.

The relationship between the settlers and the natives is another source of tension. Although King Sebastes forged a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, the prospectors of Hope regularly violate this treaty. The Poison Dusk lizardfolk are hostile to both the settlers and the Cold Sun Federation. Conflicts between settlers and scales have escalated over the last four years, and many fear that worse is yet to come.
