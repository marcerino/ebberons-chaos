**Capital**: Regalport

**Hallmarks**: Fish, mercenaries, merchants, pirates, ships

This loose confederacy of pirate lords, merchant princes, and sea barons holds the northeastern coastline of Khorvaire and the many mist-shrouded islands scattered across it. Recognized as a single allied nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, the principalities are more of a loose alliance. Each island domain has its own values, goals, and feuds with other domains. The Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During the Last War, they served all nations as privateers and engaged in piracy on the side. When the war ended, they returned to the merchant trade, but pirates still hunt on the open seas.

The Lhazaar value their independence. Here, anyone can rise to captain a ship or even seize a principality. Leadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn of Regalport seeks to forge the principalities into a unified force. He has the finest fleet, and his efforts ensured that the principalities gained recognition at Thronehold, after which he awarded himself the title of High Prince. So far, the other princes have rejected his proposals for a stronger union.

Some principalities are devoted to the Blood of Vol and a few favor the Sovereign Host. Beyond these, the Lhazaar show little enthusiasm for religion, **though many curse the Devourer when a storm comes**.

## Interesting Things About the Lhazaar Principalities p119

- Rulership of the principalities is so fluid that it's possible for someone to start the day as a sailor and end it as a prince. A campaign could easily be based around a party of adventurers gaining a principality.
- The Wind Whisperer principality includes a number of half-elves with the Mark of Storm—foundlings with no tie to House Lyrandar. The Wind Whisperers want to obtain airships by any means necessary.
- The Lhazaar Principalities have the largest changeling population in Khorvaire. Many of them congregate in the Gray Tide, a domain founded by changelings.

## Lhazaar Characters p119

As you develop a Lhazaar character or NPC, consider the following:

**Seafarers and Swashbucklers**. Most Lhazaar spend more time at sea than they do on land. Sailor is an appropriate background for any Lhazaar, but you can ask your DM if you can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.

**Local Customs**. Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with your DM to develop one that fits your character.

**Big Dreams**. Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always look to the future. What do you want? To find a forgotten treasure hoard? To command your own ship? To take your place as a prince? Think big and chase your dreams.

## Cities and Sites p119

Among the myriad ports and pirate redoubts of the Lhazaar Principalities are ancient ruins from forgotten civilizations that predate even the Dhakaani Empire, as well as tombs built by wealthy pirates and sea lords to house their treasures and earthly remains.

Presented below are a handful of the most widely known—if hard to find—places in the principalities.

### Dreadhold p119

This island prison is said to be inescapable. Maintained by [[House Kundarak]], Dreadhold houses a host of infamous criminals and political prisoners. Its vaults also hold some of the greatest treasures of House Kundarak.

### Port Verge p119

Port Verge is the royal port of the Direshark Principality. Prince Kolberkon yearns to expand Verge and overshadow Regalport, and he is always looking for capable adventurers and allies. The Blood of Vol has a strong presence in Port Verge, and Kolberkon recently allowed House Lyrandar to establish an enclave there. But Kolberkon's thirst for glory may lead him to foolish bargains.

### Regalport p119

The seat of the High Prince Ryger and the Seadragon Principality, Regalport is the grandest city in the principalities. The patriarch of House Thuranni resides in Regalport, and House Ghallanda has a significant outpost here. The Pirate Exchange is the largest market east of the Ironroot Mountains.

### Trebaz Sinara p119

It's said that the legendary pirate queen Lhazaar made her home on Trebaz Sinara, and that this island holds the treasures and tombs of generations of sea lords. However, the island hasn't been seen in over five hundred years. Many Lhazaar sailors have devoted their lives to finding the legendary lost isle.

## Aftermath of the Last War p119

During the Last War, the Lhazaar served as privateers and pirates. Outsiders wonder if the principalities can adapt to peace, or if their thirst for gold and adventure will lead their subjects to ruin.

Most of the princes are content with their domains, but ambitious rulers such as Prince Ryger of Regalport and Prince Kolberkon of Port Verge could shatter the status quo. Kolberkon seeks to expand his personal power, while Ryger wants to forge a stronger unified nation. Both pursue dangerous alliances in their campaigns. In addition to agreements with the dragonmarked houses, rumors abound of bargains with dragons, fiends, and the distant Empire of Riedra. Will the dreams of these princes lead to a new war?
