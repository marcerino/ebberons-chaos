At the world's poles—Everice to the south and the Frostfell to the north—you might...

- Discover an ancient civilization hidden beneath the ice.
- Search for the survivors of a lost expedition.
- Find the source of a mysterious mystical signal.

It's common knowledge that Everice is the domain of the Queen of Winter, an archfey who commands a host of winter wolves and knights carved from living ice. The queen lives in a glacial palace, and those who overcome her guards and the deadly weather to earn her favor can gain powerful boons.

It's also common knowledge that Everice is the home of frost [[Giants]] who escaped the destruction of Xen'drik. Now they hone their arctic magic and plot vengeance. However, a clan of white dragons battle the giants to keep them from growing too powerful. Woe betide the people of Khorvaire if dragon and giant ever set aside their ancient vendetta and join forces!

The Frostfell is thought to be the original homeland of the dwarves, and some believe that an ancient nation of dwarves still thrives under the ice. Others say that the Frostfell was once a verdant realm until the dwarves uncovered the prison of an archfiend, which buried their nation under endless ice. These scholars warn against disturbing this overlord, lest a new age of ice be unleashed across the entire world.

Mystery shrouds the poles of Eberron. A few expeditions have ventured to the Frostfell, but no one from Khorvaire has set foot in Everice in living memory and returned to speak of it.

## The Frostfell's and Everice's Influence in Khorvaire p136

In Khorvaire, you might...

- Clash with a cabal of winter warlocks serving a sinister power stirring in Everice.
- Encounter a group of frost giants or Frostfell dwarves establishing a foothold in Khorvaire.
- Discover a journal from a Frostfell expedition that reveals a horrifying threat.

The people of Khorvaire have no commerce with the arctic regions and no certainty about what lives there. If a threat comes from Everice, it might take time for people to identify its origin.

With this in mind, relics from Everice or the Frostfell could take any form. Are these treasures created by giants, fey, or dwarves? Are they carved from eternal ice, or are they forged from dwarven steel? If the civilization of the dwarves truly began in the Frostfell, did it fall into ruin, or are there progenitor dwarves who possess spells and weapons beyond anything known in Khorvaire? And how would these ancient dwarf lords react to their Mror descendants?
