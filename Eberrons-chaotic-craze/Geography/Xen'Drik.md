In Xen'drik, you could...

- Seek to destroy an ancient mystical weapon before it falls into the hands of villains.
- Battle savage [[giants]] in the ruins of their ancient cities.
- Match wits with cunning drow in the depths of a primordial jungle.

Any follower of the Sovereign Host knows this story about Xen'drik. In the dawn of time, the Sovereigns bound the fiendish overlords and freed the world from chaos. The mighty giants had fought alongside the Sovereigns, and in gratitude [[Aureon]] granted them dominion over the continent of Xen'drik. Aureon taught giants the secrets of wizardry, and they grew powerful. The giants built towers that touched the sky and seemingly endless cities.

The mightiest among the giants was the titan Cul'sir. His power was so great that he pulled the thirteenth moon from the sky and crushed it in a fit of anger. The giants ruled many lesser races, and eventually the [[elves]] rose up against them. Cul'sir unleashed plagues upon the rebellious elves. He made assassins of elven shadows and turned them back against their owners. Still the rebels persisted. In his anger, Cul'sir prepared to pull down the rest of the moons to hurl them at his enemies, even though he'd destroy the world in doing it. But the giants had gone too far, and Aureon set the dragons of Argonnessen upon them. The dragons destroyed the vast cities and leveled the towers. Cul'sir was slain and his people scattered.

The Sovereigns and Six each laid a curse upon the land. Aureon decreed that the creatures of Xen'drik would have no knowledge of law, and Boldrei proclaimed that no city would stand. The Traveler distorted the land so that no path followed twice. The Devourer unleashed fire and storm. And so Xen'drik remains a land of mystery, a realm that cannot be mapped, a place that holds secrets that could shatter the world.

This story bears at least some truth. The elves were once slaves of the ancient giants, and the dragons did eradicate the civilizations of Xen'drik. Great magic has warped the land. The environments of Xen'drik are extreme and unpredictable, and travelers might find a glacial expanse in the midst of a vast desert. Tens of thousands of years have passed, yet no civilization has risen to the heights of the fallen giants; some believe that Aureon's and Boldrei's curses ensure that any city that grows too large collapses into madness. The Traveler's Curse twists space, and explorers might follow the same path twice only to end up in entirely different locations.

Xen'drik is a continent that defies control. Expeditions have unearthed artifacts of immense power, as well as fields of Siberys dragonshards (see [chapter 5](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12)), but once you leave a site, you might never find it again.

Giants still roam Xen'drik, but these creatures have never regained the glory of their ancestors. Tribes of drow—said to be the shadow-assassins created by the Emperor Cul'sir—linger in the darkness. These represent just a few of the threats in this vast land.

## Notable Locations p139

Many ports dot the coast of Xen'drik. In addition to the treasures of the giants, Xen'drik is a source of Siberys [[dragonshard]] and other exotic resources. Scholars and merchants come to Xen'drik on business, smugglers seek to make extra gold, and pirates prey on everyone. Ports come and go, falling prey to monsters or natural disasters. But two harbors have stood the test of time.

[[Dar Qat]].

The Inspired lords of Riedra are just as interested in the resources of Xen'drik as the people of Khorvaire. Dar Qat is a Riedran port, a fortress built from glittering crysteel (grown crystal as strong as steel) and dwarfed by a nearby monolith believed to serve as a psychic anchor for the city. Outsiders are rarely welcome within the walls of Dar Qat.

Stormreach.

Once a haven for pirates and smugglers, Stormreach has become a thriving port that serves as the passage to the Xen'drik interior. All the dragonmarked houses have outposts in the city, and it is home to refugees, renegades, criminals, and others who have no place on the other continents. The city is ruled by the council of Storm Lords, who hold absolute power. As Stormreach is built on the foundations of an ancient giant city, ruins abound around and below the city. Some fear that if the city continues to expand, the growth will trigger an ancient curse. But for now, Stormreach is a prosperous community and a gateway to adventure.

## Xen'drik's Influence in Khorvaire p140

In Khorvaire, you might...

- Befriend a drow making their way in the new world.
- Stop the Emerald Claw from using a giant artifact to destroy a city.
- Aid a scholar in deciphering a book of prophecy found in the heart of Xen'drik and brought to Stormreach.

The tremendous diversity of the people of Xen'drik means that no single trait defines objects and artifacts from this land. The primitive drow make armor comparable to studded leather using the chitin of giant scorpions. Rumors abound of more advanced drow civilizations in the layers of Khyber that lie beneath Xen'drik. The elves lived and fought in Xen'drik before the exodus that took them to Aerenal, and elven artifacts remain scattered across the region. And the grandest treasures include the work of the giants—which can often be difficult to use because of their size. The spellbook of a giant wizard might hold priceless secrets, but the bulky tome can be quite awkward for smaller folk.
