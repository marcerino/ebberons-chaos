In Sarlona, you could...

- Infiltrate an empire ruled by psychic overlords.
- Defend an ancient mountain monastery.
- Disable a monolith used to control the dreams of a city.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the vast continent of Sarlona was the cradle of human civilization. Three thousand years ago, the first human colonists left, setting in motion events shaping modern-day Khorvaire.

Sarlona was once home to over a dozen distinct kingdoms, but wars devastated the continent. From this chaos, a band of saviors rose up to forge a new world. Guided by celestial spirits and endowed with vast psionic powers, these champions became known as the [[Inspired]]. Today, the Inspired have united the broken nations into a single realm: the Empire of Riedra. Outsiders aren't welcome in Riedra, and little is known of the nation. Merchants tell stories of massive monoliths that control the dreams of the people, and of secret police who use psionics to root out dissidents.

A single nation stands against the might of [[Riedra]]: the mountain refuge of [[Adar]], homeland of the kalashtar (see [chapter 1](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,1)). The Adarans lack the numbers to challenge Riedra, yet they hold their fortress monasteries against endless waves of Riedran assaults. The Adarans possess remarkable psychic and martial disciplines.

## Notable Locations p137

Like Khorvaire, Sarlona primarily occupies the northern hemisphere of Eberron, and it has all the climatic and topographic variety one would expect given its immensity. A few places in Sarlona known to Khorvairians are described below.

#### The Sharn Inquisitiveâ€”Beneath the Basalt Towers, Part 3

p138

When I first spoke to the Morgrave board, I hid the details I share with you now. I did this not from malice, nor even from fear that I would be ridiculed, but rather because I could not bear to revisit the horrors I had seen beneath the merciless Menechtarun sands. I force myself to revisit them now only in the hopes that in so doing, I can prevent any fools from following in our footsteps and sharing the fate of my fallen friends.

We'd made camp in the upper floor of the tower, for thousands of years of shifting sand had left that as the easiest point of entry. We were surrounded by cyclopean bones, and I found myself facing the empty gaze of a skull taller than I was. Melanora questioned how these grim remnants could linger for so long, but I dismissed it as the remarkable effect of the exceptionally dry climate. If only I had given more thought to this matter, Melanora might still be with us today. Instead she lies lost beneath the basalt towers, trapped in hideous service to the ancient powers that dwell in the darkness.

### [[Dar Jin]] p137

This port city is the only legal point of entry for foreigners who wish to enter the Empire of Riedra. All travelers remain confined in the foreign quarter. Merchants from across Khorvaire trade for exotic Riedran goods, while envoys from many nations negotiate with the emissaries of the Inspired. To enter Riedra proper, travelers must obtain a transit visa from the Iron Gate, the office of foreign relations. The office grants few such visas; visitors must make a compelling case for entry or find a secret way to evade the watchful eyes of the Iron Gate.

### [[Kasshta Keep]] p137

All but one of the monasteries of Adar lie concealed behind a blend of psychic and arcane techniques. Kasshta Keep refuses to hide from outsiders or the Inspired. It is the de facto capital of Adar and the abode of the Keeper of the Word, who guides the kalashtar people. High in the mountains, the monastery is reached by winches and lifts. Its inhabitants include wizards, monks, and mystics; if you want to play a monk from an exotic land, you could have learned your art in Kasshta Keep.

### [[Ohr Kaluun]] p138

Riedra built its empire on the foundation of a dozen shattered nations. Scholars consider the loss of these nations to be a tragedy... except for Ohr Kaluun. The lords of this ancient kingdom were driven by deep paranoia and an all-consuming thirst for power. The sages of Ohr Kaluun studied the darkest paths of magic and bargained with fiends and other foul creatures. They warped their bodies through mystical rituals and pacts, creating the first changelings, skulks, and tiefling bloodlines. Ohr Kaluun was ultimately consumed by the feuds of its paranoid mage-lords and the crusading legions of its neighbors. Today, it is a shunned region, haunted and cursed. Dark secrets and great treasures remain in the vast war labyrinths of Ohr Kaluun, but fiends, wards, and far deadlier threats linger in this fallen kingdom.

## Sarlona's Influence in Khorvaire p138

In Khorvaire, you might...

- Struggle to expose the schemes of an order of psychic assassins.
- Steal a memory crystal from an Inspired ambassador.
- Help an Adaran envoy deliver a vital message to a kalashtar elder.

Although outsiders aren't welcome in Riedra, the empire is a powerful nation and a valuable trading partner. Riedra offered assistance to multiple nations during the Last War. Karrnath relied on Riedran aid to survive a wave of terrible famines, and Aundair also received support from Riedra. King Sebastes of Q'barra has used Riedran troops to maintain order in [[Newthrone]].

Riedrans rarely appear on the streets of Khorvaire, but Inspired ambassadors attend every court. Although the Inspired present themselves as generous and kind, a darker force followed them across the sea. The [[Dreaming Dark]] is an enigmatic order of monks, assassins, warlocks, and mystics. Their ultimate agenda remains unknown, but they hunt the kalashtar and some believe they can control people by manipulating their dreams. While most people dismiss the Dreaming Dark as a foolish story, you might uncover the truth behind the tales.

Both the Inspired of Riedra and the kalashtar of Adar possess psychic powers, and treasures from Sarlona reflect this. A set of Sarlonan [sending stones](https://5e.tools/items.html#sending%20stones_dmg) might take the form of crystals that allow telepathic communication. The [rod of rulership](https://5e.tools/items.html#rod%20of%20rulership_dmg), [ring of mind shielding](https://5e.tools/items.html#ring%20of%20mind%20shielding_dmg), [ring of telekinesis](https://5e.tools/items.html#ring%20of%20telekinesis_dmg), [potion of mind reading](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20mind%20reading_dmg), and the [medallion of thoughts](https://5e.tools/items.html#medallion%20of%20thoughts_dmg) could represent psychic items from Sarlona.

In addition to psychic treasures, Sarlona is a source of a number of exotic plants and medicines. Dreamlily (described in chapter 4) is a useful Sarlonan narcotic, but over the course of the past few decades it has become a common recreational drug.
