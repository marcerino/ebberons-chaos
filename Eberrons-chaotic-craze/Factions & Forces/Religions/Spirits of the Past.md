As a [[Elves|Tairnadal]] elf of [[Valenar]], you were raised on the legends of your people, on tales of champions who battled mighty dragons and armies of giants. When you came of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to determine which of these ancestors chose you to be their vessel. Since that day, it has been your duty to emulate your patron ancestor. If you're a wizard, you've studied the spells created by your ancestor. If you're a warrior, you've practiced their specific martial techniques. When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies are just preparation. Now it's your sacred duty to be a revenant of your ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described in the [Monster Manual](https://5e.tools/book.html#MM).)

The bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn't speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe that they are with you—that your instincts and your reflexes are the ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new legends.

The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and conquerors. But you don't care about gold or personal glory. All you want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.

You and your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?

Since the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and half-elves can't enter this state. The Keepers say it can't be done, but perhaps you'll be the one to prove them wrong.

## Symbol p147

The primary symbol of the faith is the zaelshin, an amulet that bears the seal of your patron ancestor and worn either as a brooch or embedded in the forehead of a helmet. A devotee of the faith typically wears a veil—the zaelta, or "spirit mask"—over their lower face while in battle or performing rituals, so an opponent sees the zaelshin rather than the living elf.

The zaelshin is the symbol of the faith, but the holy symbol used by a cleric is an object associated with their personal ancestor.

## Rites p148

Services revolve around the stories of the ancestors, commemorating their glorious deeds, as well as ritual exercises and trance meditation. While resting, an elf spends four hours in trance. The faithful spend this time in communion with their ancestor, experiencing their memories and contemplating their deeds.

## Temples p148

The nomadic Tairnadal elves don't raise permanent temples. A Keeper of the Past marks a circle on the ground with their blade, and the space within becomes sanctified for the service.
