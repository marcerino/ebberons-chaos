- We, the Ashbound, are the champions of the natural world. We defend it from anything and anyone who threatens it.
- We, the Children of Winter, preserve the natural cycle of life and death. Disease and decay cull the weak and strengthen the whole. We must destroy undead and ensure that the cycle continues.
- We, the Gatekeepers, protect the natural world from the forces that come from outside it, from those beings that slither in from the darkness beyond.
- We, the Greensingers, celebrate the magic in the natural world, as well as the fey that embody that magic. We serve as ambassadors between the fey and mortals, protecting each from the other.
- We, the Wardens of the Wood, protect all the children of Eberron, from the beasts of the wild to the people of the cities. We preserve the balance between nature and civilization and help each understand the other.

All druids look after the natural world, but they act in different ways. Five well-established paths define most of Khorvaire's druids. In creating a druid character, consider whether you have ties to one of these traditions, and what led you to leave your order. Are you on a mission? Are you exploring the world? Have you been banished, with good reason or otherwise?

## Ashbound p149

The Ashbound defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.

## Children of Winter p149

The Children of Winter believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.

## Gatekeepers p149

The Gatekeepers are one of the oldest sects, primarily found among the orcs of the Shadow Marches. They act to protect Eberron from aberrations and other unnatural creatures and seek to prevent extraplanar incursions and attacks. The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.

## Greensingers p149

The Greensingers are devoted to the fey, and serve as mediators between the fey and mortals. The ranks of the Greensingers include bards as well as warlocks with Archfey patrons; a druid or ranger might also serve a specific archfey.

## Wardens of the Wood p149

The Wardens of the Wood believe that civilization has a place in the world. As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they don't cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized.

#### The Sharn Inquisitiveâ€”It happened in the Forest: Tree Hugger Tell-All!

p149

The alliance of rebel farmers in western Aundair has declared an alliance with the Great Druid Oalian of the Towering Wood, asserting that the farmlands that border these woods are now part of the Eldeen Reaches. The Great Druid is a figure of legend, a powerful mystic who serves as the spiritual leader of a diverse range of druids spread across the region. Another interesting fact about Oalian? He's a tree! Some say he's a child of Eberron herself, while others assert that he's the spirit of an ancient druid trapped in tree form. Whatever the truth, the Great Druid Oalian appears as a massive greatpine in a grove called Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.
