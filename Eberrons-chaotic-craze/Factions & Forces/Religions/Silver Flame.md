Every Thrane child knows the story of Tira Miron. Centuries ago, one of the ancient and powerful demons chained within the world broke free from its bonds, unleashing terrible suffering on the people of Thrane. The nation would have been destroyed if not for Tira Miron. This paladin was called by the Silver Flame and battled the mighty fiend. When it became clear that the overlord couldn't be destroyed, Tira gave her life, combining her spirit with the light of the Silver Flame to bind the demon once more. Now Tira serves as the Voice of the Flame, helping others find the light. Anyone who seeks to protect the innocent and battle evil can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to aid them, but they must beware of the Shadow in the Flame, the demon that still lingers and yearns to trick good people into evil.

A pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira's sacrifice, the center of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.

The church's templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira Miron.

The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders still respected the Keeper's authority over spiritual matters, but the war wasn't about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become the ruling body. While still driven by Tira's principles of redemption and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.

In creating a follower of the Silver Flame, decide whether you are bound to the church or simply inspired by its principles. As a paladin, are you part of the templar order, or were you a farmer called to action by the Voice of the Silver Flame?

The Silver Flame is centered in Thrane, but it has a strong presence in Breland and Aundair, and followers across Khorvaire. Members of the Pure Flame sect treat some species—notably shifters and changelings—with suspicion, but the faith holds that people of all races should stand together.

## Symbol p144

The faith's symbol is a stylized flame inlaid with silver. A silver arrowhead etched with the symbol serves as a common token, worn as a necklace.

## Rites p144

The Silver Flame has no need of prayers or offerings; instead, services focus on the parishioners, encouraging virtuous behavior. Church hierarchy is strictly observed, and only ordained priests can perform services.

Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, used both as a means of meditation and a martial art. Communities devoted to the Flame engage in archery training, and villages have militias of peasant archers.

## Temples p144

Fortresses of the Silver Flame are designed to serve as templar garrisons and to provide sanctuary against supernatural threats. Churches feature enormous arches and open spaces. The sanctuary of a Flamic church has a mosaic floor with a flame burning at its center.

The seat of the religion is the Grand Cathedral in Flamekeep. Built around the site of Tira's sacrifice, this fortified temple is the size of a small city.

#### The Korranberg Chronicle—No faith in Silver Flame top tyke

p144

The nation of Thrane shocked the world in 993 YK when it appointed a six-year-old child as Keeper of the Silver Flame, the supreme leadership position of the Church. Now eleven years old, Jaela Daran continues to astound all who encounter her. She possesses poise and wisdom beyond her years, and she displays the blend of courage and compassion that is the cornerstone of the faith. As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.

But some claim that these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?
