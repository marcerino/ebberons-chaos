Are people who have melted with spirrits called [[quori]].
Their connection gave them minor psyonic abilities and the sexy gene. The Spirits are of the Dreaming world. While in conncection they re not able to communicate directly with the spirit but experience visions memories and dreams.

The virtous Spirits connectet in the Kalashtar fled from [[Dal Quor]] to escape evil spirits because they beleave that the fundamental nature of Dal Quor can be changed by meditation and the Path of light. For this they are huntet by the dreaming dark. The dreaming dark seeks to destroy all the Rebelious quori.
