Build own communities prefer to be called Khoravar. Are not acceptet by their Elven Cousins into the Traditions. Humans are usually indiscriminate.

Very Hospitable towards other **Khoravar** and do what they can for each other. Have a weekly community get together cookout. The Khorarvar see themselves as the diplomats and bridges between.
