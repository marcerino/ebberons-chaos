Warforged started out as simple robots, though tremendous effort in later production lines of [[House Cannith]] became sentient. Can feel Pain etc. Have souls and are made partially out of organic material, and therefore able to be healed through healing spells. Build as weapons they must now find purpose in the new world.
Got Cristal eyes, and alchemical fluid surrounding metal and organic matter, the precise compsoition depends on the original purpose of the warforged. 
Freed from their intended way of fight and servitude through the [[Treaty of Thronehold]] the totality of the species is facing the existential dred of not knowing what to do how to act what are we??.
Little emotion, embrace a concrete purpose
 Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose-such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land-and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in reli- gion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.

The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.

The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.
