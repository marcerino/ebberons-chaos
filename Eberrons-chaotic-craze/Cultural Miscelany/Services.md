In the cities of Khorvaire, magic provides a host of minor conveniences. [Everbright lanterns](https://5e.tools/items.html#everbright%20lantern_erlw) (described in [chapter 5](https://5e.tools/book.html#ERLW,12)) light the streets. A chef heats a pot of stew with a whispered incantation, while magic amplifies a town crier's voice. The various effects produced by [prestidigitation](https://5e.tools/spells.html#prestidigitation_phb)—heating, cooling, cleaning, and minor illusion—all enhance daily life in the cities.

## Entertainment and Fashion p10

Theaters employ cantrips to amplify sound and focus lighting. Grander performances incorporate illusions, creating special effects to thrill audiences, and other spells allow actors to perform amazing stunts. Dream parlors focus on entirely illusory entertainment.

Those with the inclination to display their wealth wear [glamerweave](https://5e.tools/items.html#glamerweave_erlw), clothing imbued with illusion (presented in chapter 5). This can involve moving images, such as a cloak lined with glittering stars or a gown with a pattern of flames; the wearer might even adjust the intensity of these flames with a word. Expensive [glamerweave](https://5e.tools/items.html#glamerweave_erlw) can produce more elaborate effects, such as a gown that appears to be made of blooming flowers. [Glamerweave](https://5e.tools/items.html#glamerweave_erlw) can also create abstract effects that slowly shift colors or shimmer with a subtle glow.

## Medicine p10

The dragonmarked House Jorasco maintains houses of healing across Khorvaire. The simplest service is the expert application of the Medicine skill. For those with desperate need and gold to pay, most Jorasco outposts can provide [lesser restoration](https://5e.tools/spells.html#lesser%20restoration_phb); the best healers can also provide [greater restoration](https://5e.tools/spells.html#greater%20restoration_phb). In the finest Jorasco enclaves, it's even possible to raise the dead.

The Healing Services table summarizes typical prices for the services provided by House Jorasco.

Chippy

An excellent system of roads connects the central nations of Khorvaire. Travelers can always make their way by horse or coach, which might employ draft animals magebred by House Vadalis for speed or endurance. House Vadalis also supplies exotic mounts such as hippogriffs and griffons. Elemental galleons use bound air or water elementals to propel them.

Two main options provide long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads. The lightning rail uses bound elementals to pull a train of carriages over a path of magical stones, between which a rail-like stream of lightning arcs.

If speed is an issue, you can book passage on a House Lyrandar airship, which uses a bound elemental to hold a ship aloft and propel it through the air. This is almost the fastest way to travel, but also the most expensive. Elemental airships are a recent innovation and are relatively rare; many cities don't yet have docking towers.

For those with no time to spare and plenty of money to spend, House Orien also has teleportation circles in each of its enclaves in cities across Khorvaire. At significant cost, a member of the house will transport passengers instantaneously from one enclave to another.

The Travel Services table summarizes the cost of traveling by these extraordinary means.

Travel Services
|Service|Cost|Speed|
|---|---|---|
|Airship (House Lyrandar)|1 gp per mile|20 mph|
|Elemental galleon (House Lyrandar)|5 sp per mile|10 mph|
|Lightning rail, standard (House Orien)|2 sp per mile|30 mph|
|Lightning rail, first class (House Orien)|5 sp per mile|30 mph|
|Lightning rail, steerage (House Orien)|3 cp per mile|30 mph|
|Magebred coach (House Orien)|3 sp per mile|5 mph|

## Warfare p11

After a century of war, magic plays an ever-increasing role on the battlefield. Massive magical siege staffs fill the role of artillery. Semi-sentient warforged titans can scatter squads of infantry. Arcane sappers may spread [glyphs of warding](https://5e.tools/spells.html#glyph%20of%20warding_phb) to deny a region to an enemy. Wands and rods haven't replaced the swords or bows, but elite wandslingers, as military spellcasters are often known, are becoming ever more common.

The nations of Khorvaire all employed different forms of battle magic during the war. Aundair fielded the greatest number of wizards, while Breland produced floating fortresses and other engines of war. The nation of Karrnath embraced the practice of necromancy and animated hordes of undead soldiers.

In the final decades of the war, House Cannith created the warforged: tireless soldiers formed of metal and other materials. The Treaty of Thronehold forbade the creation of new warforged and granted freedom to those that survived the conflict. Warforged now seek places to call home across Khorvaire, but these living weapons struggle to find their place in a world at peace.
