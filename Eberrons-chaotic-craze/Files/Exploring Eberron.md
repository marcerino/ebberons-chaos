Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons & Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world--which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.

I'm extremely proud of the world we've created. However, there are elements I love that I've never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations--considering the civilizations that the merfolk, sahuagin, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down--or in some cases, cut entirely--in our original *Eberron Campaign Setting.* The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn't nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.

From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a *Planes of Eberron* sourcebook, but it never came to pass--and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn't have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I've always had dreams of Droaam and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the *Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron*, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron's history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*--the official fifth-edition hardcover--the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn't enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.

That's where Wayne Chang, who works with me on the podcast *Manifest Zone*, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I've always wanted to explore--the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations--as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!

As it turns out, writing a book of this size is a *tremendous* amount of work. Laura Hirsbrunner accomplished herculean tasks as both editor and layout designer, while Will Brolley developed immersive monsters, magic items, archetypes, and more. Since working in a vacuum is a good way to die of asphyxiation, I'm incredibly grateful to Laura, Wayne, and Will for being a constant source of feedback and inspiration.

We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova's wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens chapter 3, to Marco Bernardini's amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it's been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life. In some instances, to convey a concept to an artist, I put my own limited artistic skills to work. Below is my first draft of a sahuagin city built around one of the slumbering kar'lassa--and in chapter 4, you can see how Vincentius Matthew made sense of my sketch!

I'd be remiss if I didn't also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive--including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis--who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.

Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You'll find a few details that don't align with previous sourcebooks; it's up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there's always a third option: using *your* answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now--when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death--we wanted Eberron to *inspire* players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon--and some, you might even ignore. This presents *my* Eberron, but I'm always thrilled to see people making the world their own.

And now--Eberron awaits!

>>"You think it's safe?" The crackling arcs of energy wreathing the elemental engine cast a pale blue light across the platform. Dela smiled back at him. "It's perfectly safe, Rev. Haven't you been on a lightning rail before? What you see there is just a secondary manifestation--"
>>
>>"Not that." The warforged soldier's voice was deep and solemn, like a heavy drum. "This task. The mountains. The island. The journey into dreams. Rusty says it's impossible."
>>
>>"Just because something's never been done doesn't mean it's impossible. It just means it's a problem I've never tried to solve. But safe? No, it's definitely not safe." She reached up, resting her hand on his steel shoulder. "That's why I'm bringing you."
>>
>>Rev gave a single, slow nod. A series of clicks emanated from his right arm, a sound quite familiar to Dela; the warforged was testing his embedded armblade, preparing it for release.

Eberron is a world shaped by the rise and fall of great ancient civilizations. It's a setting scarred by the impact of the Last War and defined by the ongoing evolution of magic and artifice. What were the weapons of the Last War? How is magic a part of everyday life in the Five Nations? What events of the distant past could play a role in the present day?

## Ages Past

The present is shaped by the past. The shadow of the Last War hangs over Khorvaire, setting the stage for conflicts ahead. But Khorvaire also bears the marks of struggles far more ancient. The goblins in Sharn's slums are descended from the founders of a mighty empire, and they rightfully feel that humanity stole their homeland. The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters. The Church of the Silver Flame was founded at the end of the third century, but it's simply the latest manifestation of a conflict that began at the dawn of time--a battle still fought in the shadows by the fiendish Lords of Dust and the dragons of the Chamber.

*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* touches briefly on Eberron's history, but a detailed accounting of the world's hundred-thousand-year recorded history could easily fill an entire book. This section provides an overview of ancient history, focusing on aspects that are particularly relevant to adventurers--presenting echoes of each era that can be seen in the present day and suggesting story elements that could inspire modern adventures.

### The Dawn of Creation

*Period: Dates unknown*

Before history began, legend holds...

- The three Progenitor dragons created the planes.
- In a cosmic quarrel, Khyber destroyed Siberys. Eberron then bound Khyber within her own body, forming the world.

No one knows what came before the world's creation. In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation--that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.

Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world.

Knowing she couldn't defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below.

While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don't worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she's the source of all life, but doesn't actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.

Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there *is* a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest.

### The Age of Demons

*Period: More than 100,000 years ago*

During the Age of Demons, myths tell us...

- Eberron was dominated by the overlords, thirty archfiends who shaped reality to their will.
- Champions, later known as the Sovereign Hosts, fought the overlords with an alliance of dragons and couatl.
- The sacrifice of the couatl bound the overlords with a force that formed the silver Flame.

According to the Progenitor myth, Eberron became the world and all natural creatures are her children. But in the first days of the world, the children of Khyber--fiends, aberrations, and other monsters--rose up from the darkness and claimed dominion over the world. The greatest among these were the overlords, immortal archfiends embodying the evils that plague mortals. Each overlord shaped the world to match their whims, and no civilization could challenge them. It was a time of chaos that lasted for untold millennia.

The Age of Demons came to an end after an extended war between the overlords and a legendary group of champions--now known as the Sovereign Host. Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods--or perhaps something else entirely--these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn't be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords. Even today, the overlords remain bound and the world protected from immense evil by this force, now known as the Silver Flame.

#### Why Does It Matter?

The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It's commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons--for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It's up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.

While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison... and there's no official list of all of the overlords or where they are bound. So if a story calls for a region where the restless dead rise and prey on the living, this could be the prison of Katashka the Gatekeeper. If a region is suddenly overcome by ice and snow, perhaps the shard-prison of Dral Khatuur has been brought there.

Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. As they reach higher levels, adventurers might even become active participants in this struggle instead of mere pawns. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.

Dungeons from the Age of Demons are rare, few surviving the passage of time. Any remaining sites would be infused with fiendish or celestial power. A vault created by the couatl could hold a deadly artifact tied to an overlord. An obsidian fortress might be imbued with Rak Tulkhesh's power, and people who settle there are consumed by homicidal rage. One of the best documented sites is Ashtakala, an ancient city in the heart of the Demon Wastes said to be the sanctuary of the Lords of Dust.

#### Character Ideas

Though the overlords are bound and the Sovereigns no longer walk the earth, consider these ways your character might be caught up in their legendary struggle:

- You have a dragonshard embedded in your flesh, the source of some of your class abilities (e.g. warlock magic or barbarian rage). This is a sliver of an overlord's prison. How did it come to be part of you? Do the Lords of Dust want to take it from you, or are you destined to become an avatar for an overlord?
- You possess an object your parents swore once belonged to a Sovereign. Currently it has no magical powers, but perhaps there's some way to activate its potential.
- You were born in the Demon Wastes and spent your life battling fiends. Have you traveled south pursuing a particular fiend? Or do you follow visions granted by the Silver Flame?

### The Age of Giants

*Period: 80,000--40,000 years ago*

During the Age of Giants, scholars describe how...

- Giant nations in Xen'drik unlocked secrets of arcane magic still unmatched in the modern age.
- The giants fought the inhabitants of Dal Quor, ending the conflict by destroying a moon and thereby breaking Dal Quor's link to Eberron.
- The giants threatened to crush an elvish rebellion with dangerous epic magics, prompting the dragons to step in, utterly destroying Xen'drik and cursing the land.

In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen'drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons' increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber's power (see chapter 3), the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.

Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen'drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it's thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul'sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it's not known whether the Cul'sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.

These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul'sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the elves--both those oppressed by the Cul'sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul'sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen'drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler's Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du'rashka Tul--"the madness of crowds"--causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.

#### Why Does It Matter?

The curses laid on Xen'drik mean that the entire continent is in essence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped or explored. The giants mastered secrets of arcane magic as yet unmatched by humanity or even by the elves, and as such Xen'drik is a source for powerful artifacts, spells, and eldritch machines. Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to recover a Cul'sir artifact could easily drive an adventure, and Sulat weapons could shift the balance of power in Khorvaire if they fell into the wrong hands.

While Xen'drik's many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn't stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach lies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to be explored.

#### Character Ideas

Though the Age of Giants has faded into legend, consider these ideas how your character might encounter its echoes today:

- As an elf, you're haunted by trance-visions of an ancient city of your distant ancestors hidden somewhere in trackless Xen'drik. What is the force that's calling you there?
- As an artificer, you're on the edge of an arcane breakthrough, but the final piece of the puzzle is tied to the work of the giants. You'll need to search through their ruins for clues.
- You possess a trinket from Xen'drik--a prospector's map? an ancient key?--tied to an ancient Sulat vault.
- You own a deed to a small stretch of land outside of Stormreach. Will you try to develop it?

### The Age of Monsters

*Period: 40,000--5,000 years ago*

During the Age of Monsters, history recounts that...

- Elf refugees fleeing the devastation of Xen'drik settled in Aerenal, birthing the Undying Court, the Aereni, and the Tairnadal.
- Goblins and orcs dominated Khorvaire, while dwarves, dragonborn, gnomes, and halflings had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.
- The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan flourished for ten thousand years, then was destroyed when the daelkyr invaded the Material Plane. Thought he daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.
- The daelkyr conflict destroyed the dwarven Realm Below.

After Xen'drik was shattered by the dragons, they remained isolated in Argonnessen. Human civilization was slowly taking shape on Sarlona, but the most dynamic cultures of this period were forming on and around the continent of Khorvaire. The elves founded a new homeland on Aerenal--"Aeren's rest" in Elvish--instituting the Undying Court and establishing the cultures that would become the Aereni and the Tairnadal. On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire. The Dhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes--the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with the dragonborn of what's now Q'barra, the dwarves of the Realm Below, and Tairnadal explorers, but none could stop the advance of Dhakaan.

However, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations through portals from Xoriat, the Empire of Dhakaan was shattered--along with the Realm Below, the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves (see chapter 4).

Though this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani champions and Gatekeeper druids sealed the daelkyr in Khyber, the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to creating monsters such as dolgaunts and doppelgangers, the daelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness. One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids' shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization (see chapter 4). Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of Khorvaire were ruins and chaos.

#### Why Does It Matter?

Dhakaani ruins are scattered across Khorvaire. Most major cities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations, and there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have been largely ignored by the human inhabitants. A Dhakaani ruin could be viewed as a simple dungeon, but these are the remnants of a proud civilization; what an adventurer sees merely as a useful magical weapon could be an important cultural relic of the goblins. While the Empire wasn't as advanced as the civilizations of giants that came before, the daashor artificers of Dhakaan--discussed in depth in chapter 4--produced remarkable artifacts and were master weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of adamantine and other exotic alloys.

This is the story that underlies both the rise of Darguun and the recent emergence of the Heirs of Dhakaan. Before the arrival of humanity, goblins and orcs shaped the destiny of the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim that ancient glory.

Though it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the daelkyr incursion is still felt across Khorvaire. The cults of the Dragon Below and the Gatekeeper druids are active legacies of this conflict. As described in chapter 4, the Mror dwarves are venturing into the ruined Realm Below and recovering daelkyr symbionts and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed--and scheming--in Khyber, adventurers could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.

#### Character Ideas

Whether your character is a goblinoid, orc, or a more recent inhabitant of these lands, consider these ways the Age of Monsters might inform your past and your future:

- As a character from the Shadow Marches, you carry an heirloom amulet you've sworn to keep safe. Have you learned that it's part of the wards that bind the daelkyr in Khyber--and that cultists bound to a particular daelkyr will be hunting you, trying to destroy the amulet?
- You're obsessed with the early history of Khorvaire and are always searching for leads on ancient Dhakaani ruins and daelkyr relics. Are you a city goblin or Tharashk half-orc searching for your roots? Or just a scholar of another race that's fascinated with the period?
- As a Dhakaani goblinoid (see chapter 4) you are an advance scout for a Dhakaani *kech*. Were you sent to reclaim lost Dhakaani artifacts, or are you studying the people of the surface, identifying weaknesses, and considering if any are worthy allies?
- You possess a Dhakaani weapon, claimed by your ancestor and handed down through your family. There is power in the blade, but it only flows through a bearer when they prove worthy... and you haven't. Can you master the blade? And what will happen when you encounter the Heirs of Dhakaan?

## Recent History

![Artist: Wren Hunter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/10%20wren%20hunter.png)

Scholars at Morgrave University call the last five thousand years the Age of Humanity, contending that its defining trait is the rise of human civilization and its spread from Sarlona to Khorvaire. The gnome sages of the Library of Korranberg call it the Dragonmarked Age, asserting that the appearance of the dragonmarks and the achievements of the dragonmarked houses are more significant in the grand sweep of history than mere human achievements. Most people dodge this debate by simply referring to it as the modern age.

Regardless of where you stand on this argument, a great deal has happened over the last five thousand years. This section begins with an abbreviated timeline, highlights some pivotal moments in Eberron's history, then delves into some of the more interesting events of recent millennia.

### The War of the Mark

*Period: Approximately 1,500 years ago*

The first aberrant dragonmarks appeared soon after the true dragonmarks. At the time the dragonmarked houses joined together as the Twelve, aberrant marks were spread across the Five Nations. Some members of the Twelve truly saw aberrant marks as abominations; others considered them a convenient scapegoat to unite the houses and strengthen their position. House propaganda and whispering campaigns amplified the perception of aberrant marks as dangerous and uncontrollable. Fear progressed to violence, and in time, to squads of Deneith soldiers, Vadalis trackers, and Medani inquisitors "protecting communities from the aberrant threat."

Aberrant dragonmarks of the time were generally more powerful and dangerous than those of today. The Twelve took true stories of innocents harmed by uncontrolled marks and amplified them--superstition and fear did the rest. The title "War of the Mark" implies two even sides, but this was more of a purge than a struggle of equals. Toward the end, however, a few aberrant-marked champions rallied others and challenged the houses. The most infamous were Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague, who seized Sharn and declared it a haven for those with aberrant marks. Eventually, the forces of the Twelve laid siege to the city. When Tarkanan and the Lady saw victory was impossible, they unleashed the full power of their marks. Tarkanan's mark gave him power over the earth, and he shattered the towers. The Lady of the Plague called vermin up from the depths and spread vile diseases in the ruins. Both the aberrants sheltering in the city and the armies attacking it perished, and Sharn remained in ruins for centuries before Galifar I finally reclaimed it.

Aberrant marks were almost completely eradicated during the War of the Mark. When they reappeared in later centuries, they were far weaker than Halas Tarkanan's earth-shaking power, but fear and prejudice linger. Over the last century, with no explanation, aberrant marks have begun manifesting with greater frequency and power. The criminal organization known as House Tarkanan has begun organizing and training those with aberrant marks, fearing another purge could lie ahead.

#### Why Does It Matter?

Aberrant dragonmarks don't seem to deserve the prejudice leveled against them. They aren't that powerful, and player characters rarely lose control of their marks. But everyone knows that Halas Tarkanan shattered the towers of Sharn, the Lady of the Plague destroyed her village as a child, and the Dreambreaker was a monster who drove people mad as amusement. As a character with an aberrant mark, you bear the burden of centuries of superstition, stories encouraged and exaggerated by the Twelve. And the leaders of House Tarkanan point to the War of the Mark as a possible path the future might take. If you have an aberrant mark, will you join House Tarkanan and prepare to fight the Twelve? Or will you try to change public perception and fight the fears?

### The Kingdom of Galifar

*Period: 1-894 YK*

Karrn the Conqueror failed to unite Khorvaire by force, but centuries later, his descendant Galifar Wynarn succeeded through might and clever diplomacy. Galifar didn't just want power--he wanted to build a better world, and on many levels, he succeeded. He abolished slavery and instituted laws that promised justice for all. Over time, the kingdom would promote public education and the rise of the merchant class. It can be argued that Galifar stumbled in giving the dragonmarked houses too much economic power; while the Korth Edicts prevent dragonmarked heirs from holding lands or titles, they also lay the foundation for the near-monopolies the houses hold today.

Galifar can also be faulted for his precarious system of succession. By this tradition, the children of the reigning monarch served as governors of the five provinces, with the eldest governing Cyre. The previous governors served as regents until an heir came of age, at which point they were expected to step aside. This system led to multiple rebellions and attempted secessions over the course of history, the Last War simply the largest and last of them.

#### Why Does It Matter?

A century of brutal war has divided the people of the Five Nations, but they are still united by a host of common laws and customs--the legacy of Galifar. And there are still many who look back to Galifar as a golden age, who would be willing to go to war again for a chance to return to that supposed paradise.

Many of the institutions that define the nations--the Arcane Congress, the King's Citadel, Rekkenmark Academy--were originally dedicated to the common good of Galifar. Members of the longer-lived races, such as elves and dwarves, likely trained at these institutions, regardless of the nations they serve today.

### The Silver Crusade

*Period: 830-882 YK*

Before the ninth century, lycanthropy was largely just a fearsome legend. Lycanthropes were known in the wilds of Khorvaire, but few people had ever seen one; most commoners thought lycanthropes and shifters were the same thing. Early in the ninth century, something changed--the curse of lycanthropy became more virulent, and its victims were driven to ever more extreme behavior. Werewolf attacks and wererat infestations became an increasing problem in western Aundair, and by 830 YK, some feared that an apocalyptic threat was brewing in the Towering Wood--that any day a horde of lycanthropes could sweep across the land and destroy all civilization.

In 832 YK, Keeper of the Flame Jolan Sol declared that lycanthropy corrupted the soul itself and must be completely eliminated. An army of templars was dispatched to Aundair, and servants of the Flame across Khorvaire were ordered to be vigilant and root out lycanthropes in hiding. And so they did.

The Silver Crusade lasted for nearly fifty years. The first two decades were a brutal, bloody campaign. The lycanthropes were massing in great numbers on the edge of the Towering Wood (now part of the Eldeen Reaches), driven by some unknown evil; most sages believe it was an overlord on the verge of breaking its bonds. The templars were outmatched. The lycanthropes were cunning and could quickly replenish their numbers, and they intentionally stirred up conflict between templars and shifters. But after decades of bitter conflict, the tide slowly turned in favor of the templars. And somehow, the power of the curse was broken. Lycanthropy continued, but its effects weren't as strong, its victims not so driven to darkness.

While the true threat was dealt with, the peasants of Aundair had suffered through decades of terror and sought a greater revenge. The next thirty years saw an ongoing inquisition as zealous converts to the faith--later classified as an extremist sect, the Pure Flame--sought to hunt down every remaining lycanthrope. In the process, many innocents--including a great many shifters--were tortured and slain. So the Silver Crusade began as a selfless act that may well have saved Galifar, but ended up as an outlet for paranoia and hatred.

#### Why Does It Matter?

The Silver Crusade is a classic example of a virtuous act with bloody consequences. It highlights that the goals of the Silver Flame are to protect the innocent, but fear, greed, and anger can lead reasonable people astray. It's the origin of the Pure Flame, an extremist sect whose narrow vision of the Flame is as a ruthless weapon with which to burn evildoers. It has created a deep rift between shifters and followers of the Silver Flame, and hurt the reputation of shifters everywhere.

In the wake of the Silver Crusade, lycanthropy is considered to be a serious public health risk. Templars deal with any confirmed lycanthropes--when possible, they seek to apprehend and cure them, but lethal force is always an option. Lycanthropes can find a safe haven in Droaam (especially with the Dark Pack), and there are still a few scattered 'thropes in Stormreach, Q'barra, Darguun, and other frontier nations.

If you're playing a follower of the Silver Flame or a shifter, think about your view of the Silver Crusade. Likewise, if you're from Aundair or the Eldeen Reaches, consider if your family suffered during the lycanthropic terror.

### Untold History

Galifar stood for almost a thousand years before collapsing into the Last War. This section has highlighted some particular moments in history that can be used as inspiration for adventure. But both in this book and in the wider canon of Eberron lore, there are vast stretches of time that remain largely undeveloped.

Within your campaign--whether as player or Dungeon Master--feel free to develop and explore additional moments of history if they enhance the stories you want to tell. The Untold History table provides a starting point for ideas. As a Dungeon Master, this can be a way to add depth to a story. Have the players arrived at a currently unremarkable inn? Perhaps two hundred years ago, that inn was the headquarters of an alliance of peasants that rose up against the monarchy, only to be brutally suppressed--and they still don't think much of characters with the noble background! Or in developing a character, perhaps one of your ancestors was a wizard who made an important arcane breakthrough, only to have it covered up by the dragonmarked houses.

The crucial point is that established history is a place to start, nothing more. Use the ideas presented here when they can help you. But always feel empowered to expand the world and develop the history of *your* Eberron, even if it may not match official sourcebooks that come out in the future.

## Cyre: Before the Mourning

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/14%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

*The Jewel in Galifar's Crown. Wondrous Cyre.* Cyre was the heart of the united kingdom of Galifar. But what was the nation actually like? Since Cyre has fallen, lore often focuses on the current plight of the refugees and not on the nation they lost. As a Cyran character, what are the memories you treasure? What was your childhood like? If you hope to rebuild your nation, what is it that you aspire to recreate?

### What Our Dreams Imagine

Galifar Wynarn was a military genius, but it was his eldest daughter Cyre, twin to Aundair, who imagined the warring nations working together as a single family: Karrnathi might, Daskari faith, and the wisdom of Thaliost working together for the greater good. In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows--the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future. Cyre's motto captures the heart of this nation and its people: "What our dreams imagine, our hands create."

The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King's Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together--the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the *everbright lantern*, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece--a city of wonders--this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.

This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever. The people of Cyre can trace their roots to all of these nations, believing they share these strengths; and beyond that, Cyrans strive to be creative, innovative, and artistic.

Cyre's artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith's greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It's said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There's no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. "What our dreams imagine, our hands create," but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.

This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar's traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch's children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.

#### Outer Cyre

Galifar's goal with Cyre was to create something new, a culture combining the best aspects of the other nations. In the newly forged Thrane, Aundair, and Breland, the people kept their old traditions, and ruling families were often incorporated into the new governing structure; similarly, Galifar preserved the customs of his homeland of Karrnath. But in the old kingdom of Metrol--which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland--the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre's dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.

***Southern Cyre.*** covered what is now Darguun. Largely unsettled when Galifar was founded, it persisted as a backwater in the shadow of the kingdom. Its people ultimately prospered and took pride in their identity as Cyrans, mimicking the customs of the central kingdom. However, they had little of the wealth invested in the north or the wonders that came with it. There were ongoing clashes with goblins, a few severe, but the Ghaal'dar goblinoid clans largely remained in the mountains and dark places until the Last War.

***Eastern Cyre.*** --now Valenar--was effectively a separate nation with a dramatically different culture and values. It was arguably Galifar's greatest failing. The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it's because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called "thrones"), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime.

### Cyre and the Last War

Under the reign of King Jarot, Cyre continued to shine. Aspiring artists and young nobles made their way to the heart of the kingdom, while the most promising artificers settled in the city of Making. King Jarot lavished attention on Cyre--expanding the Vermishard Palace, working with House Orien to expand the lightning rail within Cyre, and spending hundreds of thousands of galifars on the Wynarn Institute of Art and the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host.

Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre's finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a paladin, Karrnath is a fighter, Aundair is a wizard, and Breland is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard--elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.

Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar's treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be--and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King's Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre's new military academy. But it was clear that the Cyran dream had been sustained by many hands, and now the nation had to learn to stand on its own.

### Cyrian Style

For a millennium since its founding, Cyran culture blended the traditions of other nations. However, the Last War built walls between Cyre and the other nations, and each evolved in this century of relative isolation. Cyrans know the old add-a-verse songs beloved by Aundairians, but few know the *Epic of Valiant and Vigilant*, a tale of martial bravery close to the heart of every modern Aundairian. Nor do they know the maxims of Beggar Dane that now serve as a cornerstone of Brelish culture.

Even so, Cyrans see their culture as being founded on the best principles of Galifar, and can still find some common ground with people of any nation. A Cyran can play Conqueror with a Karrn, sing an add-a-verse song with an Aundairian, and debate religion with a Thrane. This reflects the founding principles of Cyre--to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there's no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there's always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera--a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it's a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they're constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation--that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better. But the Cyrans themselves assert that this approach is rooted in love, not arrogance, and call it the "Cyran appreciation."

In playing a Cyran, you can find familiar things anywhere you go. But what do you treasure in your memories of Cyre? Do you cling to the past, or do you embrace the Cyran principle of always striving to find a new and better way?

#### Fashion

Cyran fashion blends practicality with endless diversity. Cyran clothing begins with a simple foundation--this base layer may be colorful, but it's first and foremost practical and durable. Whether breeches, skirts, shirts, or gowns, a Cyran starts with whatever the wearer finds most comfortable. Again, this base level is well made, but it's more functional than decorative.

After starting with simplicity, the Cyran adds flair. Cloaks and gloves are both integral parts of Cyran fashion. Gloves can be short and sturdy for work or war, or long and decorative for more formal occasions. Cloaks likewise vary between the practical and decorative: a heavy cloak for traveling, a short cape for casual socializing, and a long, light cloak with a *glamerweave* lining for an evening at the Grand Stage. In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion. Often made from copper, leather, wood, or glass, Cyran jewelry is not a display of wealth, but rather a way to express individuality. Feathers and bells are also common accessories; there is a Cyran dance that involves belled bracelets and anklets. Finally, masks are often worn at formal or festive occasions. Cyran masks aren't intended to conceal identity or intent; rather, they are a way of enhancing identity and expressing a mood.

Traditionally, Cyran fashion is filled with color (often accentuated with *glamerweave*). In the wake of the Last War, many Cyrans have adopted Mourningwear--clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black. Others celebrate their nation by preserving its styles. Because of the emphasis on durability, your Cyran character may still have the clothes they were wearing on the Day of Mourning. What was that outfit, and do you still wear it? Do you favor a mask, and if so, what is its design?

#### Cuisine

Cyran cuisine reflects the Cyran principles of working with the best of all traditions while continuing to explore. In many ways, this is similar to the Sharn fusion found in the City of Towers, and a number of Cyran refugees are rising stars in Sharn's culinary scene. Cyrans blend the thrakel spices of Thrane with traditional Karrn stews, and add the heat of southern Breland to the delicate pastries of Aundair. While many refugees cling to family recipes as a way to remember the fallen nation, others continue the tradition of Cyran appreciation--adopting new favorites from the place they've found shelter and looking for ways to improve them.

#### Magic

Traditionally, Cyrans viewed arcane magic as an art form as well as a practical tool. This lent itself to a wider study of illusion and enchantment than found in other nations. But it's also about the presentation of magic, regardless of its school. Whether magewright, bard, or wizard, Cyrans often put more show into the performance of magic than even the Aundairians. For a wizard who's studied at the Wynarn Institute, somatic components are almost a dance, while verbal components have the cadence of song or poetry. This echoes the Cyran love of flowing capes and cloaks. As a Cyran spellcaster, you are truly a student of arcane arts; consider how your casting reflects this.

### Cyran Religion

The Silver Flame had some devoted followers and temples in central Cyre, though the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith. However, religion is driven by faith and tradition, and Cyrans have always been encouraged to question and search for new paths. Outer Cyre is a different story. The nobles of Eastern Cyre were and are devout Vassals, convinced they have a divine right to leadership. The people of Southern Cyre are less arrogant, but most hold to a quiet, steadfast faith in the Sovereigns.

The war drove some Cyrans to embrace their faith more tightly, but for others it was another source of doubt. Likewise, the Mourning threw many devout Cyrans into a crisis of faith, while for others, it actually strengthened it. A devout follower of the Silver Flame doesn't question the cause of the Mourning, they simply seek to protect the innocent from harm. Vassals of the Sovereign Host trust that there is a purpose to their suffering. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Mourning, some Cyrans have turned to the Blood of Vol or cults of the Dragon Below, cursing the gods they once worshiped or following a darker vision. There are also a number of new strains of the old faiths, Cyran twists on the Flame and the Host that seek to adapt traditions to make sense of the war and the world.

In playing a Cyran, whether a divine caster or other religious character, consider the impact the Mourning had on your faith. Are you conflicted and struggling to hold to your beliefs? Or was the Mourning a source of inspiration--you know you have a divine purpose, that your people need you? If you're tied to an existing faith, do you follow the standard traditions or have you found an unusual path?

### The Three Cyres

When most people say "Cyre," they're thinking of central Cyre. When they speak of Cyran refugees, they are referring to the people who fled the Mourning. But there were Cyran refugees long before the end of the war. The Tairnadal elves established the eastern kingdom of Valenar in 956 YK, while Lhesh Haruuc claimed Southern Cyre as Darguun in 969 YK. While Valenar was an unpleasant surprise, it had relatively little impact on the nation. Eastern Cyre had always been isolated, and the Khunan majority embraced elf rule; the refugees were thus a handful of nobles who were painfully out of touch with the traditions of the central kingdom. The loss of Darguun was a more significant blow; Southern Cyre was a backwater, but this was still close to home, and it resulted in a flood of refugees that the war-torn nation was ill-prepared to handle. In creating a Cyran character, consider which Cyre you're from.

#### Central Cyre

If you're from central Cyre, odds are good that you think of your home as the "true" Cyre. Before the Mourning, did you give much thought to the refugees of Valenar and Darguun? Even now, do you think of them when you think of your homeland? Are you devoted to the idea of rebuilding your nation and clinging to your memories and traditions? Or following the Cyran appreciation, are you instead looking forward and trying to find a new and better path, even if that means abandoning the dreams of Cyre?

#### Eastern Cyre

As an Eastern Cyran, you're tied to a noble family with roots in old Metrol, before Galifar even existed. You don't accept any of the nonsense about Cyre being "the best of Galifar" or challenging tradition; if people had stuck to the old ways, perhaps all of this could have been avoided. Your people were devoted to the Sovereign Host and truly believed that Aureon had chosen you to rule. At the same time, your lands have been lost for over forty years, and the people of central Cyre have never avenged you or shown your family the respect you deserve. You're not as affected by the Mourning as some, because it wasn't your Cyre that was destroyed--now the others just get to see how you feel. While your character has noble ancestry, you're unlikely to choose the noble background, as nobody would care about such claims. Do you despise the Valenar and hope to reclaim your long-lost homeland? Or do you want to rally Cyran survivors around the *true* royal bloodlines, challenging Oargev and reestablishing the long-forgotten kingdom of Metrol?

#### Southern Cyre

Your people have been struggling for decades in Southern Cyre, eking out a life in camps and shelters. You were encouraged to take up military service--it was easier to send you to the front than to find a new home for you. Many of your friends and family chose to idolize Queen Dannel and central Cyre, believing that she had a vision and would rebuild Galifar, restoring an age of wonders. Did you feel that way? Were you an optimistic idealist? Or were you bitter and angry at the nation that failed to protect you? Are you loyal to Cyre, or are you solely concerned with Darguun and taking vengeance on the goblins?

### The Wonders of Cyre

Cyre was a land of wonders, but it's now lost to the Mournland, leaving Cyrans with only memories. Some of its most renowned marvels stood in Metrol, including... 

#### The Vermishards

Seven spires rise up from Metrol, a natural (or supernatural) wonder. These plateaus held the ancestral homes of the noble lines of old Metrol with the Royal Vermishard the seat of the Cyran crown. However, over centuries, other powers--such as House Cannith and House Phiarlan--made their way to the Vermishards as well. Cannith and Phiarlan worked together with Cyran magewrights to embed illusory lighting into the Vermishards, their glittering spires becoming a remarkable part of the Metrol skyline.

#### The Wynarn Institute of Art

The Wynarn Institute was both one of the foremost academies of magic in Khorvaire and one of its most amazing museums, exploring the artistic potential of the arcane. Treasures of the pre-Galifar kingdoms were displayed here along with modern works of art. In addition to purely artistic exhibits, the Hall of Kings allowed visitors to converse with illusory replicas of the past rulers of Galifar. Though some cultures preserve their rulers so they can advise successors--such as the Aereni elves in chapter 3 and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal in chapter 4--the illusions of the Hall of Kings were merely a tourist attraction.

#### The Vault

The Royal Treasury of Galifar was commonly known as the Vault. While there were reserves hidden around the kingdom, the Vault included both the mint, Cyre's primary reserves of currencies and precious metals, and important cultural artifacts deemed too valuable to be displayed. Salvagers have dreamed of finding this "Golden Palace," but there are some stories saying that the Vault no longer remains where it was built, but is actually missing. The Mourning had strange effects on Metrol, and it's possible the Vault was simply physically displaced, or it could have fallen into another plane.

#### The Cathedral of the Sovereign Host

Following the spread of the Church of the Silver Flame in Thrane, the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host became the primary seat of Vassal devotion on Galifar. Many of the rulers of Galifar would build an addition to the Cathedral as a way of showing their piety. By the reign of King Jarot, it was a wonder indeed. Nine colossal statues encircled the temple, illusory displays within depicted scenes from the faith, and it held a vast collection of relics and artifacts. The fate of the Cathedral and its treasures remains unknown.

#### Countless Wonders

These wonders just scratch the surface of what was possible. Aundair had floating towers; Cyre expanded on this with floating gardens, flower petals falling on the wind to the cities below. Even small towns had crystal theaters where audiences could scry on the great performances in the Demesne of Shape. There was always music in the air and lights in the sky. With this in mind, feel free to *create* wonders of your own imagination. Cyre was the seat of House Cannith and House Phiarlan, second only to Aundair in arcane sophistication. What your dreams imagine, their hands could create. And even if they *didn't* create the things you dream of, people might believe that they did, as the legends of Cyre only continue to grow now that the kingdom is lost.

### Playing a Cyrian Survivor

As a Cyran, you come from a culture that strove to find the best in all things, that encouraged creativity and innovation. But your people also lived through a century of betrayal and war, fighting enemies on all sides. How has this affected you? Are you an idealist who still believes in the promise of Galifar--someone who believes that the Five Nations can and should unite, someone who tries to bring people together? Or do you curse the traitors who betrayed Mishann and doomed Galifar? Are you scarred by the memory of the Mourning and determined to reclaim your homeland--or rebuild it somewhere else--or are you always looking forward to what happens next? Do you have any living relatives, and if so, where are they now and what is their situation? Will you send money to your family in High Walls or New Cyre, or are you alone in the world? Where was your home and what did you leave behind? Is there anything you wish you could recover from the Mournland, whether something with practical value or simply sentimental? What do you still possess that reminds you of Cyre?

## The Last War

The Last War shaped the modern age. *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* explores the bitter grievances lingering after a century of strife and discusses options for running campaigns set during the war itself. The third-edition sourcebook *Forge of War* presents a detailed timeline for the war. This section expands on the tools of modern warfare and the ways in which this conflict might shape a character.

At a glance, Khorvaire can appear medieval. Soldiers carry spears and swords and Thrane is renowned for its archers. But magic is a central part of life in the Five Nations, used for communication, transportation, entertainment... and war. What weapons were employed on the battlefields of the Last War? What forces can be found patrolling the borders? And what were some of the major innovations of the Last War?

To clarify what lies ahead: This section does not present a system for running mass combats. Rather, it explores the tools and tactics used in the Last War so that adventures can incorporate those elements into the story. This allows for an adventure in which the heroes have to make their way through a field of *blast disks*, or must seize a siege staff to halt bombardment. But this section doesn't include a system detailing artillery spotting and the accuracy of sustained bombardment. It explores the tools of the Last War with the intent that they could appear in traditional adventures.

### Arcane Artillery

Wands, staffs, and rods are well-established weapons in the world of Eberron. Similarly, arcane artillery doesn't employ any sort of physical projectile, relying solely on magical energy--but rather than a small weapon one person can easily carry, arcane artillery refers to a variety of larger arcane foci that can increase the range and area of magical attacks. Likewise, the war employed magical explosives such as *blast disks* that could wreak devastation by triggering a previously stored spell.

As a general rule, the everyday magic of the Five Nations encompasses spell effects of up to 3rd level; while 4th- and 5th-level effects exist, they are rare and remarkable. This means that effects like *wall of force* could be seen on the battlefield, but were exceptional and rarely deployed, while blasts of fire and lightning were more common.

#### Operating Arcane Artillery

While a specially trained spellcaster must operate arcane artillery, more than one person can assist with its operation, allowing a team to prime, aim, and fire in a single round.

All attack rolls and saving throws are based on the spellcasting ability of the operator firing the weapon. When arcane artillery is used to target someone at long range, any attack roll has disadvantage and any saving throw against the spell effect has advantage.

Using these weapons requires specialized training, similar to that of an artificer or magewright; someone trained to operate arcane artillery is generally called a bombardier. A typical bombardier may use the magewright stat block, but they also know one or more spells that they're only able to cast using a focus--such as a siege staff or long rod. So an Aundairian specialist might be able to produce *cloudkill* through a focus, but not cast the spell on its own. Bombardiers don't use spell slots when casting these spells; instead, they prime the weapon using a dragonshard solution known as the *breath of Siberys*.

However, player characters are more versatile than magewrights or bombardiers. The DM could allow your spellcasting character to use artillery without penalty if it fits the needs of the story or if you have a background that justifies it--for example, if you're a wizard with the soldier background. Otherwise, the DM could say that you can operate it at a penalty: you can't cast spells or make attacks at long range; your attack rolls have disadvantage; and saving throws against your attacks have advantage. As a player character, you can prime the weapon using the *breath of Siberys*, or you can expend a spell slot as usual when priming the artillery.

#### Enhanced Artillery

While arcane artillery is a powerful force, there's still a place for mundane siege engines that use physical projectiles, described in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. The ballista, mangonel, and trebuchet are all common forms of artillery, seen on both the battlefield and on warships. However, just as a Thrane archer may have used an enchanted bow, the siege engines of the Last War are enhanced with magical power.

***Animated Engines.*** A siege engine can be partially animated, speeding its use. Generally, an animated engine loads itself while the crew aims it, requiring only two actions to fire an animated ballista or three to use an animated mangonel. House Cannith also manufactured fully animated siege engines, capable of self-aiming. Such an engine required the same number of actions to aim and fire as a crewed engine, it simply had no need of a crew. However, these engines could only follow simple instructions and had little ability to adapt, requiring clear, absolute orders to be effective: *"Continue to attack the north tower until it is destroyed."*

***Cannons.*** A cannon is a weapon that can inflict significant bludgeoning damage at great distances. As noted in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, a cannon doesn't have to use gunpowder, and those used in the Last War did not. The most common form of cannon is the *elemental cannon* produced by the gnomes of Zilargo, which uses the essence of a bound earth elemental to project stone cannonballs with tremendous force; Zilargo began supplying Breland with these weapons toward the end of the Last War. While Cannith and the Five Nations experimented with other cannon models, the siege staff typically filled this role on the battlefield.

***Enchanted Ammunition.*** Ballista bolts and mangonel missiles are often enchanted with spell effects that trigger when the bolt strikes its target. This effect is in addition to the standard damage inflicted by the siege engine.

- *Explosive ammunition* affects a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the bolt. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Typically, *explosive ammunition* deals fire damage, igniting flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. However, Karrnathi *deathbolts* deal necrotic damage and only harm living creatures, while Thrane *Tira's tears* deal radiant damage.
- *Summoning ammunition* conjures creatures around the point of impact. Aundairian *firestones* produce a temporary flaming sphere that randomly rolls around the area of impact. Zil binders developed a more powerful form of this ammunition which casts *conjure elemental* on detonation, but it is extremely costly and rare.
- *Panic stones* force all creatures within a 90-foot-radius sphere centered on the impact of the stone to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw drops whatever it is holding and becomes frightened for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use the Dash action to move away from the *panic stone*. If an affected creature ends its turn more than 90 feet away from the *panic stone*, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for that creature.

#### Arcane Explosives

The *blast disk* is the most common form of magical explosive used in the Five Nations. While *blast disks* serve a similar role to bombs or landmines, they can produce a wide range of magical effects; a *blast disk* could trigger a burst of confusion and start a riot, or summon a rampaging elemental into a crowded town square.

All nations employed *blast disks* during the Last War; when exploring abandoned battlefields, untriggered *blast disks* are an ongoing threat. While all nations used simple force or fire explosions, there were a few variations tied to specific nations:

- Aundair made extensive use of high-powered *blast disks*; they were infamous for dragonhawk squads equipped with *cloudkill* disks.
- Breland utilized the base model of explosive disks.
- Cyre experimented with psychoactive effects--*confusion*, *fear*, and explosions that dealt psychic damage.
- During the ascendancy of the Blood of Vol, Karrnath created disks that first dealt necrotic damage, then inflicted effects such as *danse macabre*--killing victims with the initial explosion then animating the corpses to prey on survivors.
- Thrane developed *blast disks* that dealt radiant damage--a useful tool against Karrnathi undead. Toward the end of the war, Thrane was working on *dawn* disks

While the basic *blast disk* is a common magic item, under the Code of Galifar, they're illegal for civilians to own or carry. House Cannith manufactures *blast disks*, but won't sell them to civilians (at least, not openly). So if you're looking for a *blast disk*, you'll need to have criminal connections or build your own.

The following statistics describe the standard rules for *blast disks*, but more powerful versions can be created to serve the needs of a particular story. A powerful *explosive disk* could have a radius of hundreds of feet instead of just twenty, while a *cloudkill* disk could unleash a force that expands as it moves and lingers for hours or days.

Many different forms of artillery and explosives were developed during the war, often abandoned once they proved too expensive or difficult to produce. The above are only a few examples of the magic-empowered tools used during the war, and as always, you are encouraged to introduce others if they enhance your story.

- *Blast Disk*

> ##### The Scale of Damage
>
>At first glance, the damage associated with many weapons described here may seem low. How is it that a massive siege staff could end up dealing less damage than a *staff of fire*? But in developing weapons of war, consider who those weapons are targeting. The typical soldier in the armies of the Five Nations would use the **guard** or **bandit** stat block, both of which have 11 hit points. When large numbers were called for, nations would employ peasant levies, most of who would use the **commoner** stat block with a mere 4 hit points.
>
>Hit points are an abstract concept, a "combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck." That range of 4-11 hit points is normal; a typical person on the street could be mortally wounded by a single well-placed crossbow bolt. The high hit points of exceptional individuals--such as player characters--reflect their role as heroes, people who somehow avoid a deadly strike or who can grit their teeth and persevere through damage that would send a lesser person into shock. When designing weapons and battle magic, the mages of Arcanix and artificers of the Twelve were using the typical soldier as the baseline, not a player character.
>
>So consider the *fireball*. It has a range of 150 feet, affects a 20-foot sphere, and deals 8d6 fire damage. This is designed for an elite squad fighting against exceptional foes: it deals high damage with a significant area of effect. But imagine you're fighting 120 guards with longbows, who start shooting at you once you enter their long range of 600 feet. You may never get close enough to cast your *fireball*. Even if you do, the damage output is far greater than you need (an average of 28 damage against enemies with 11 hit points). *Fireball* is an excellent tool for a small squad engaging powerful foes, which describes the typical party of adventurers. But on a battlefield of common soldiers, it proves inefficient, as range and radius are more important than high damage output. The siege staff may not inflict as much damage as a *staff of fire*, but it hits more enemies and from farther away.
>
>This impacts how scenes unfold when your player character is on the battlefield. In the interests of story, the DM doesn't want your party to be wiped out by the first blast of a siege staff; how is that a compelling adventure? Instead, that blast might deal only 12 points of fire damage. It drops half of the soldiers accompanying you (who failed their saving throws), but you and your companions take shelter from the worst of the blast and keep pressing forward. 3d6 damage may feel low because it won't kill a player character. But it can kill commoners and typical soldiers; the fact that adventurers can keep going under fire shows how remarkable they are.

### Air Forces

While the elemental airship is a recent innovation, aerial combat has long been a part of warfare. Flying scouts are a basic component of reconnaissance. Aerial commandos can bypass fortifications and strike at the heart of the enemy. Air cavalry equipped with ranged weapons or spellcasters can make devastating strikes on ground troops.

#### Flying Mounts

These beasts are the most common form of aerial cavalry. Most are bred and trained by House Vadalis, though a few nations have their own personal traditions:

- **Hippogriffs** are the most common Vadalis flying mount. All nations used these to some degree.
- **Griffons** are another Vadalis staple. Tougher than hippogriffs, griffons were often used to carry a strike force into the middle of a conflict, fighting alongside their passengers.
- **Pegasi** are exceptional mounts, but are rare and can't be forced into service. The House Vadalis enclave in Sharn is one of the few places where they're trained, and Breland has an elite force of pegasi riders.
- Many Mror clans have established relationships with **manticores**, and Kundarak is known for its manticore cavalry.
- Aundair is renowned for its dragonhawks, creatures similar to **giant eagles**, and long ago adopted them as the nation's national symbol.
- Since long before Galifar, the nobles of Thrane have maintained a small stable of **wyverns**.

While these are especially notable examples, many other animals--including glidewings, giant hawks, giant eagles, and **giant owls**--are used as mounts and could be encountered during the Last War. This diversity is reflected in Sharn's annual Race of Eight Winds.

While one rider needs to guide the beast, larger mounts can carry multiple riders. A hippogriff can bear a single archer or wandslinger, while a griffon or wyvern can carry several. Thrane was the first nation to employ *bags of holding* to devastating effect, allowing a rider to carry a supply of *blast disks* or, more simply, to drop any number of large, heavy objects.

#### Flying Creatures

**Gargoyles** make excellent scouts and couriers, while **harpies** can have a devastating disruptive effect on troops. House Tharashk only began selling the services of these creatures in 988 YK, so they were never fully integrated into the war effort. However, a number of nations are still exploring ways to effectively exploit the capabilities of these creatures.

#### Magic Items

In addition to its beloved dragonhawks, Aundair also deployed elite units equipped with *brooms of flying*. Other nations managed to duplicate these on a smaller scale, using them for scouts and spies, but Aundair was the only nation that fielded actual squads of broom riders in battle.

#### Elemental Airships

The first elemental airships went into service in 990 YK, just four years before the Mourning. Airships require a Lyrandar pilot, and initially Lyrandar was loath to devote its vessels to purely military service. It was only in 994 YK that they produced a small number of "stormships." Today, Lyrandar is likely working with *someone* to develop aerial warships, but it's up to the DM to decide which nation(s) they're working with, if any.

### Wandslingers

Magic evolves. When Galifar I forged his kingdom, his wizards hadn't mastered *fire bolt* or *ray of frost*. The development of the cantrip--casual spells that can be used at will--took centuries, as the Arcane Congress studied Aereni techniques and the powers of sorcery. The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the *war staff* and *battle rod*. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it's no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people "arcane dragoons." If you fight your battles with *fire bolt* or *sacred flame*, you're known as a "wandslinger."

#### What is a Wandslinger?

At its simplest level, a wandslinger is any individual capable of casting a damage-dealing cantrip. Beyond that, it's about how you present yourself to the world. If you know the *fire bolt* cantrip--whether as a wizard, a sorcerer, or because you took the Magic Initiate feat--you could be a wandslinger. Do you carry an *arcane focus*? If so, do you display it prominently? Do you carry your *wand of Fernian ash* with pride, twirling it and doing flame tricks? If so, you're a wandslinger. By contrast, if you're a scholarly wizard who despises conflict and prefers not to use an arcane focus, you're *not* a wandslinger, even though you are just as capable at magical combat. As much as anything, it's about attitude.

#### NPC Wandslingers

The typical NPC wandslinger can be based on any stat block, adding the ability to cast at least two cantrips. Most arcane dragoons could also cast at least one 1st-level spell. An exceptional wandslinger may know additional cantrips or spells as fits the needs of the story. The "Battle Magic: Range and Radius" sidebar presents two new wandslinger spells.

Since NPCs don't follow the same rules as player characters and player characters are exceptional, the DM may decide that an NPC wandslinger needs an arcane focus in order to cast a spell. Player characters are versatile; it's useful for you to have a wand, but you can work around its absence. The typical arcane dragoon needs a wand, rod, or staff in order to cast a spell or cantrip. Here are a few examples of NPC wandslingers:

- **Aundairian Dragoon.** Cantrips known: *force blast*, *shocking grasp*. Spells known: *concussive burst* (1/day).
- **Brelish Firebrand.** Cantrips known: *fire bolt*, *light*. Spells known: *burning hands* (1/day).
- **Cyran Phantasm.** Cantrips known: *force blast*, *minor illusion*. Spells known: *shield* (1/day).
- **Karrnathi Ghoul.** Cantrips known: *chill touch*, *poison spray*. Spells known: *cause fear* (1/day).
- **Thrane Beacon.** Cantrips known: *sacred flame*, *spare the dying*. Spells known: *guiding bolt* (1/day).

#### Other Specialties

While wandslingers are becoming more commonplace, at the moment this is still an elite specialty. By adding wandslinger capabilities to a standard stat block, such as a guard, you are reflecting specialized training, much like a player character acquiring a feat. If you want to add more national flavor to current or former soldiers, you can add different feats to a stat block. Thrane is known for its archers; if you want to represent an elite Thrane archer, you could use the scout stat block but add the benefits of the Sharpshooter feat. Karrnath fielded exceptional heavy infantry, and a Karrnathi knight could gain the benefits of Heavy Armor Master.

> ##### Battle Magic: Range and Radius
>
>As Aundair expanded the use of arcane dragoons, it saw the need for spells that could match the range of the Thrane archers, or bring down large numbers of peasant levies. *Force blast* is a simple spell that lacks the offensive punch of a *fire bolt*, but has greater range than a longbow and a rarely resisted damage type. *Concussive burst* isn't as deadly as *burning hands* or *thunderwave*, but it covers the same area as a *fireball* while being accessible to a wandslinger. These spells may not appeal to player characters, but you could find them in the hands of enemy wandslingers.

#### Wands and Staffs

The wandslinger is trained to use an arcane focus: the power isn't in the wand, it's simply a tool for channeling a spell. But what of magic wands, staffs, and rods? Under the wide-magic principles of Eberron, common and uncommon items are part of the magical industry; rare items are exotic and expensive; and very rare and legendary items are largely beyond the capabilities of Cannith and the Arcane Congress. As such, weapons such as a *wand of fireballs* or *wand of lightning bolts* could be found on the battlefield, especially when dealing with Aundair, but they were rare, only assigned to elite units and critical operations.

However, House Cannith and Aundair's Arcane Congress are always working to produce more efficient weapons, and the *wand of magic missiles* is one such recent development. Prior versions of the wand were more expensive, could only be used by trained spellcasters, or didn't regain charges. The *wand of magic missiles* breaks this barrier: it's an uncommon magic item that doesn't require attunement and can be used by any creature. A wealthy wandslinger could carry a brace of wands, unleashing a barrage of bolts from a new wand each round. *Wands of magic missiles* may be found in the hands of criminal enforcers, royal guards, or any number of other professionals, and can potentially be purchased across the Five Nations. However, they were perfected by the Arcane Congress just twelve years ago, and House Cannith has yet to replicate that technique. As a result, these wands are primarily found in Aundair or used by Aundairians; a wand being sold in Sharn may be surplus or salvage recovered from Aundairian soldiers during the war.

Sooner or later House Cannith will duplicate this item and they'll become available at any Cannith enclave. But for now, these wands can still be difficult to find outside Aundair.

### Warforged Titans

Throughout the Last War, Cyre poured gold into House Cannith's coffers, urging them to develop ever-deadlier weapons. In 959 YK, Cannith presented Queen Dannel with the first warforged titans. For a time, this gave Cyre an edge--but as always, Cannith began selling these creations to other nations, as well as selling *blast disks* and siege staffs to those who needed to fight titans.

During the Last War, the warforged titan served a number of critical roles. The mere presence of an imposing titan provided a defensive bulwark for infantry, as enemy infantry could rarely afford to engage a titan without artillery or magical support. Titans are tireless, surprisingly swift, and capable of crossing almost any terrain. Thanks to the Siege Monster ability, they are also devastatingly effective against fortifications and siege engines.

The statistics of a basic warforged titan, as described in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*, grant it additional versatility from its Platforms trait. A titan has two platforms in its chassis, each designed to hold one medium or smaller creature. Typically, these platforms hold archers, providing the warforged with some minimal ranged support to complement its powerful melee attacks. However, specialized crew can dramatically increase the capabilities of a titan: an evoker can provide strong ranged attacks, while an abjurer can stand ready to counter or dispel enemy magic, and an onboard artificer can keep the titan operational. Sending your titan against Karrnathi undead? An exorcist can be a boon for dealing with undead. Alternatively, a titan could simply serve as a battering ram, carrying two spies or commandos ready to leap off and blend into an enemy community as soon as the titan breaches a defensive wall.

While the warforged titan stat block represents the basic design, over the course of nearly forty years in service, there were many variations on that design. Consider using one of these options as a way to add flavor to a titan.

#### Armbow

One of the titan's weapons can be replaced with an integrated ballista. This weapon is self-loading and conjures ammunition. If the titan has an armbow, replace either the axehand or hammerfist with the following attack:

***Armbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:*  +7, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:*  16 (3d10) piercing damage.

#### Long Rod

Late in the war, Cannith developed titans that had only one platform, with a long rod (as described in the "Arcane Artillery" section) integrated in place of the other platform.

#### Shielding

Titans serving in particular regions were often shielded against a relevant type of elemental damage. For example, force and fire were the damage types most typically tied to *blast disks* or siege staffs, so Cannith often designed titans with resistance to one of these damage types.

#### Troop Transport

The titan has a hollow space within its chassis and can carry up to 6 Medium creatures or extra cargo. Due to the loss of body mass, a model made for transport only has an Armor Class of 18 and 100 hit points, but increases its walking speed to 45 feet.

#### Titan Consciousness

While called "warforged," the titans are quite different from the truly living constructs that came after them. Titans have limited sentience. They imprint on their commanders, and to a lesser degree, on the uniforms of their allies. They can follow orders and general instructions such as "protect allies" or "engage enemies." But as a rule, titans don't feel emotion, reflected by the fact that they're immune to being charmed or frightened. Today, most remaining titans are simply waiting in storage, content to remain motionless until it's time to serve again.

Yet there are stories of titans who've developed full consciousness. If the tales are true, this could be the result of rogue artificers (possibly cultists of the Traveler hidden within House Cannith), or it could be a random spark of evolution--suggesting that the potential for sentience lies within all titans.

A sentient titan loses its immunity to psychic damage. It's no longer immune to being frightened or charmed, but it has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause these conditions. Its Intelligence increases to 10 (or higher) and it is capable of making its own decisions.

### War Stories

Khorvaire has suffered through a century of war, the conflict ending with the Treaty of Thronehold just two years ago. As an adventurer, you are someone with remarkable talents and skills. Did you serve in the war? If so, what nation did you fight for and in what capacity? If not, why not? Do you feel no loyalty to your homeland? Do you oppose the idea of war? Or did you just have something better to do with your time?

The third edition sourcebook *Forge of War* details the events of the war, while *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* explores ways that it can shape an adventure. This section explores how the war can shape characters--things to consider while creating your character and ideas that could inspire you moving forward.

#### How Did You Serve?

If you're human, you grew up surrounded by war. If you're a member of a longer-lived race, you may remember a time before the war--but if so, you were alive for many decades of conflict. How did it affect you? How is this reflected by your character background, or your ideals or flaws?

The Last War Backgrounds table provides ideas for characters shaped by the Last War. What impact did the war have on your life? You don't have to take the Soldier background to have served in the Last War; someone with an Outlander background could be a scout, while a Sage or Guild Artisan might have maintained arcane artillery. Regardless of how you served, which nation are you from? Do you feel loyalty to your nation, and if so, do you despise your former enemies? Or do you support peace and hope for a new era of unity in Khorvaire?

#### What Have You Lost?

A century of war has left deep scars across Khorvaire, both physical and psychological. Regardless of whether you fought in the war or not, it's almost certainly touched your life in some way. Consider the Losses in the War table and decide if any of these ideas might apply to your character.

#### Ongoing Conflict

The war is over, but nobody won. How do you feel about it? As an adventurer, perhaps you believe that it doesn't really concern you. You may be glad the war is over and look forward to a new era of peace and international cooperation. On the other hand, if you're a patriot, you may have strong feelings about the war and current peace. Consider how your character feels about the following topics.

***Nationality.*** If you're from one of the Five Nations, how do you feel about the others? Are you proud of your nation's actions during the war, ashamed, or ambivalent? Do you blame the citizens of rival nations for the losses you've suffered? What about the new nations that have emerged during the war--Valenar, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, the Mror Holds, and Droaam? Do you support these nations, or do you consider them to be traitors and rebels?

***Lost Lands.*** Thrane still holds the Aundairian city of Thaliost, and this is far from the only town that's changed hands. Darguun and Valenar seized land from Cyre, and the Eldeen Reaches split from Aundair. Do you have attachments to one of the new nations? If you're from one of these regions, are you a fervent supporter of your young nation, or are you ambivalent to the struggles it may face? If you're tied to one of the lands that was lost, do you want revenge or to restore your homeland?

***Rivals or Revenge.*** Consider what you've lost and what you've been through. Did you make any enemies during the war? Have you sworn to one day get vengeance on the Karrnathi general who slaughtered your unit and raised your dearest friends as undead? Or perhaps the cruel commandant who had you tortured in a prison camp? The incompetent Cannith magewright who supplied your troops with faulty weapons? Or do you have a more friendly rival--a fellow soldier who always outshone you on the battlefield that you're determined to outdo in the future?

## Magic in the World

There are challenges facing every society, problems that need to be solved. Communication. Transportation. Even entertainment. In Khorvaire, magic is the tool people use to solve these problems. But what does that look like? Everyone knows about the lightning rail and the elemental airship. But what about when you walk into a tavern or down the main street of a small town? The Magical Ambience table provides a few examples of everyday magic seen at work.

This section explores many different aspects of how magic works in Khorvaire, from the role of cantrips and common magic items to the magic services that adventurers can take advantage of.

### Wide Magic

The Five Nations are built on a foundation of magical tools and services. Arcane magic is understood to be a form of science: anyone with the aptitude for it can train at a house trade school to become a magewright or learn how to be a wandslinger. There's nothing strange about seeing an airship in the sky or sending a message to a distant friend using a *speaking stone*.

However, a common maxim about Khorvaire is that it possesses "wide magic, not high magic." While the *speaking stone* allows you to send messages between two stone stations, *sending* is a rarer service that fewer people can afford. *Lesser restoration* is available at any good Jorasco healing house, but *raise dead* isn't so trivial.

As a broad rule, the people of Khorvaire are used to dealing with tools and services that mimic cantrips or spells of 1st and 2nd level. They're familiar with 3rd-level spells--*fireballs* on the battlefield, aristocrats using Sivis *sending* services--but these things are expensive. Effects of 4th or 5th level are known--Orien maintains a network of teleportation circles, the dead can be raised, an oracle can cast *divination*--but these things aren't part of everyday life, and the typical commoner doesn't expect to run into them. Magical effects of 6th level or higher are usually the product of more advanced civilizations--the dragons of Argonnessen, the elves of Aerenal, the ancient giants of Xen'drik. The same principle applies to magic items. Common and uncommon items are part of everyday life. Rare items exist, but they're rare. And very rare and legendary items are typically the product of advanced civilizations or remarkable events.

There are exceptions to this rule. There are higher-level spellcasters in the world: Mordain the Fleshweaver, Jaela Daran, the Great Druid Oalian. But civilization is built on a foundation of common and uncommon items, and spells of 3rd level and below. High-level spellcasters are capable of remarkable feats, but these can't yet be mass produced.

#### Common Magic Items

Common magic items are common throughout Khorvaire. This isn't to say they are trivial--*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* sets the price of a common magic item at 2d4 × 10 gp, so even the simplest item will cost 20 gp. A farmer might treasure her *everbright lantern* and the gown of *clothes of mending* that has been in her family for generations, while a wealthy young noble may flaunt his *glamerweave* and *cloak of many fashions*.

Common magic items generally aren't all sold in one place. A high-class tailor will sell both mundane and magical clothes, but you can't buy an everbright lantern at their shop. People don't see these things as a separate class of "magic item"; they're simply the most effective tools of their type.

Beyond this, consider that both in price and description, there's a wide range of quality between items, reflected in the range of price. A 20 gp *everbright lantern* is ugly but functional, while for 80 gp you can get one inlaid with beautiful patterns, and you might even be able to adjust the shade and brilliance of the light source. *Glamerweave* is clothing that's been imbued with illusions: both the quality of the base clothing and the illusion factor into the cost, and the finest glamerweave can be far more than 80 gp. In short, the magic item description tells you what a common item *does*, but it's also an object beyond that, and it's good to think about its form and quality.

#### Uncommon Magic Items

*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* only calls out common magic items, but at the DM's discretion, uncommon magic items can also be purchased in major cities (especially in Aundair). Such items are more expensive--the price is typically between 200-500 gp, set by the DM based on the power and quality of the item--but selection will be far more limited. Just because you could theoretically purchase a *cloak of protection* doesn't mean one is always available in that particular shop or town. However, an exceptional weaponsmith may have a *+1 weapon* for sale or take a commission to create one, and large House Sivis enclaves often sell *sending stones*. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide what sort of uncommon magic items are available and who is selling them.

#### Dragonmark Focus Items

Chapter 7 includes a list of dragonmark focus items. These represent that it's easier to create an item that can only be used by someone with a dragonmark--presenting focus versions of other magic items, but with a reduced rarity. Dragonmark focus items can only be created by a character with the Mark of Making or the dragonmark used by the item; while they are more common than similar items that work for unmarked characters, they are typically only available through the dragonmarked houses and often only as rewards for house service.

#### Static Items

Most magic items are portable and designed for adventurers. However, you may also encounter magic items that are meant for industrial use. Just as a dragonmark focus item is easier to create because of its limitations, a large, immovable industrial item can make a rare or uncommon item's properties accessible to the public. An Aundairian village may have a large *cleansing stone* set into the town square. If a theater has a magical tool that can generate *minor illusions*, it could be similar in size and shape to a pipe organ. Essentially, in thinking about the magical items that people may encounter, keep in mind that they aren't necessarily designed for use in adventuring!

### Magewrights

The magical economy of Eberron is built on the backs of the **magewrights**: spellcasters who know a handful of cantrips or rituals that allow them to provide vital services. Wizards are exceptional; their ability to prepare any spell with a few hours of study reflects remarkable talent and versatility. By contrast, a magewright knows few spells, but because of their intense focus on those spells, they're able to cast them in ways others cannot.

An artificer is equally exceptional. Most of the people assembling magic items at Cannith forgeholds aren't artificers; they work using industrialized processes, massive tools that enhance the creation process (like the *creation forge*), and house resources. These craftspeople couldn't just create a wand at home alone. By contrast, as an artificer, you are unconventional, using personalized techniques and improvising solutions.

Just because *you* can create any common magic item with little time and effort doesn't mean that this is typical or that others could duplicate your work. Never forget that in Eberron, *player characters are exceptional*. Even at low levels, you have potential that the common magewright can't match. There are also exceptional NPCs, ones who can do things player characters cannot; but remember that as a player character, not everyone who follows your path can match your abilities.

#### Magewright Spells

For simplicity's sake, magewrights cast spells from the existing spell lists. But magewright spells are unique in a few ways. First of all, magewrights cast all their spells as rituals--even spells that don't normally have the ritual tag. The drawback is that they can only be cast as rituals with an extended casting time. All magewright spells have a minimum casting time of 10 minutes, and the DM can choose to give a spell an even longer casting time; it may take a medium a full hour to cast *speak with dead*.

As magewrights can only cast spells as rituals, they don't use spell slots. But they do require a surge of magical energy to power the spell, typically generated by refined Eberron dragonshards, the fuel of arcane industry.

When a magewright performs a ritual, it consumes an amount of Eberron dragonshards worth 20 gp × the spell's level, in addition to any costly material components of the spell. This is the cost to the magewright to cast the spell; they might charge far more for offering that service to others, generally at least twice the casting cost. Following the general limitations of everyday magic, it's unusual to encounter a magewright that can cast a spell of 4th level or higher, and any such magewright would likely charge a significant premium for their services.

> ##### New Cantrips
>
>Here are two new cantrips you might find employed by a magewright, other NPC, or player character in Khorvaire.
>
>- *Aundair's Silent Sanctum*
>- *Magecraft*

At DM discretion, a magewright's spells may have expanded--or limited--effects. Consider what it takes to make a spell a viable commercial service. For example, *augury* only allows the caster to predict events 30 minutes in the future--useful for adventurers in the midst of a dungeon, but not for the farmer wanting an opinion on planting crops. A professional oracle might be able to predict woe or weal anywhere from a day to a week in advance--but such an oracle could have very specific limitations, such as only being able to make predictions related to weather or agriculture. As a DM, use the existing spells as a model, but adjust them as necessary to create a viable business.

Player characters can't duplicate these effects. The unique aspects of magewright spells reflect both their devotion to a single subject and personal aptitude; the oracle has a unique talent for divination that even a diviner wizard can't replicate. Player characters have unmatched potential and great versatility; magewrights are extremely limited, but have unique advantages.

#### Casual Cantrips

In Aerenal, almost every citizen knows a few cantrips. The Five Nations aren't quite so advanced; there, cantrips are common, but still reflect specialized training. Most people rely on common magic items; a magewright can be proud of their talents, though just as magewrights have a narrow spell selection, their cantrips are also more limited than those used by player characters. A magewright chef uses effects similar to *prestidigitation* to heat and flavor food, but they can't conjure illusions or extinguish flames. The idea is that the most versatile cantrips--such as *prestidigitation* and *thaumaturgy*--represent knowledge of a range of discrete spell effects, all categorized under one greater cantrip. Your spell list merely says *prestidigitation*, but that encompasses a host of lesser cantrips; when you extinguish a fire, you're actually casting *incendiary purge*, and when you chill your drink, you're performing *culinary transmutation*. While this has no effect on player characters, consider that magewrights and other lesser spellcasters might only know limited forms of common cantrips, such as the following:

***Boldrei's Broom.***  You clean an object or surface made from wood, stone, or metal no larger than 1 cubic foot.

***Culinary Transmutation.*** You chill or warm up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material.

***Grogan's Grime.*** You soil an object or space no larger than 1 cubic foot.

***Halan's Dramatic Entrance.*** You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window within 30 feet to fly open or slam shut.

***Incendiary Purge.*** You extinguish a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

***Kellan's Kindling.*** You light a candle, torch, or small campfire.

***Phiarlan Whispers.*** You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within 30 feet, such as a rumble of thunder, the hooting of an owl, or ominous whispers.

***Shol Flame.*** You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.

***Tialaen Tongue.*** Your voice is up to three times as loud as normal for up to one minute.

***Verran's Textile Restoration.*** You clean an object made of cloth or leather no larger than 1 cubic foot.

***Zolan Zest.*** You flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material; this lasts for one hour.

#### Magewrights in Action

Magewrights weave magic into their work. They are not only limited spellcasters, but skilled professionals who use magic as a tool. In addition to a limited range of magic ability, magewrights are also skilled in the mundane aspects of their specialty. A magewright chef doesn't make food by snapping their fingers; they're skilled with cook's utensils, as well as using *culinary transmutation* and *Zolan zest* as tools in their repertoire. Below are a few examples of magewright professions.

***Arcane Locksmith.*** Locksmiths are typically trained by the Warding Guild of House Kundarak, and most people expect a locksmith to be a dwarf. An arcane locksmith is proficient with *thieves' tools* and *tinker's tools*, using these for most of their work. They can cast *arcane lock* and *knock* as rituals. When casting these rituals, they use tinker's tools as an arcane focus, tracing symbols and sprinkling powdered dragonshards over the object to be locked or unlocked.

***Artisans.*** Blacksmith, cobbler, or cooper, a typical artisan is proficient with their tools and learns mending and magecraft. The *magecraft* cantrip allows them to enchant their tools and supplies, creating the perfect conditions for their work. Most receive this training from the Fabricator's Guild of House Cannith, but others apprentice with local magewrights, while adepts cast *magecraft* by invoking Onatar or the Traveler.

***Healer.*** Professional healers are usually trained by House Jorasco. A healer is proficient with Medicine and *Herbalism kits*, using these to treat common injuries. They know the cantrips *spare the dying* and *detect poison and disease*, and can perform *lesser restoration* as a ritual, but the ritual uses the herbalism kit as a focus and includes the trappings of mundane healing. They don't just snap their fingers to cure people; they use pinches of herbs and tap glands and pressure points.

***Medium.*** No dragonmarked house trains mediums. Instead, some come from communities steeped in the Blood of Vol, while others are Vassals who invoke Aureon and the Keeper. A medium performs *speak with dead* as a ritual, and many use a form of *minor illusion* to conjure up an image of the deceased in conjunction with the ritual. Some less-scrupulous mediums rely on Insight, History, or Deception to simulate speaking with the dead without going through the full ritual.

***Oracle.*** Every oracle has a preferred method of divination. Some use cards, others use bones or dice. The bread and butter of the oracle is *augury*. As noted earlier in this chapter, most oracles can use *augury* to make predictions stretching further into the future than the spell normally allows, but they may be limited in the subjects they can predict--some oracles only make predictions related to agriculture, while others discuss romance. Greater oracles may have the ability to cast divination, but this requires the oracle to have a connection to a spiritual guide. A religious adept will deal with a celestial tied to their faith, while a secular oracle may deal with a fiend or other spirit.

***Truthteller.*** Licensed by the Warning Guild of House Medani, truthtellers are proficient in Insight and can cast *zone of truth* as a ritual. The ritual casting includes a lengthy invocation and chalk symbols traced across the area of effect. The truthteller knows if someone succeeds or fails their saving throw, and encourages them to voluntarily submit to the ritual; thus, saving against it will be seen as an attempt to evade questioning.

The above are just a few examples of magewrights. A launderer uses *Verran's textile restoration* to clean the toughest stains, while a professional stagehand uses *Phiarlan whispers* or *Shol flame* to add details to a performance. The critical element is to see these things are part of their profession. They aren't dropping everything to cast a spell; the spell is incorporated into the way in which they perform their job.

#### What About Adepts?

Arcane magic is a science--magewrights master its techniques. However, there are other forms of magic which can likewise be adapted to everyday functions. An adept derives their magic from their faith, a more limited form of what a cleric can do; similarly, a gleaner masters the simplest forms of druidic magic. Especially with the adept, this is more of a calling than a job; you don't decide to become an oracle of Aureon, you find that you are gifted with visions. The rituals of an adept invoke divine forces, while a gleaner draws on the world around them and often uses an herbalism kit as a spellcasting focus. Adepts are common in Thrane and other religious communities, while gleaners provide useful services in the Eldeen Reaches.

> ##### Telling Time: Chronal Cantrips
>
>The people of Eberron don't use mechanical clocks, and if you're in a Mror mine or the heart of one of Sharn's towers, you can't see the sun. So how do you tell time?
>
>The answer is simple: magic. There are a wide range of cantrips that tell time--some tied to an absolute time, some tied to the moons, some set to a local time. In Eberron, any character that has the skill to cast *prestidigitation*, *thaumaturgy*, or *druidcraft* can produce an additional effect allowing them to tell time. Clocks in Eberron are common magic items, and in most major cities, bells are rung to identify the hour; three bells means "three o'clock." An *orb of time* is another common magic item--a small polished stone disk, often connected to a chain like a pocket watch--that tells time.

### Magical Services

This section supplements the list of magical services presented in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*, offering a few additional services as well as options for some existing ones.

#### Entertainment

Most theaters employ illusions to add special effects to a performance, whether provided by magewrights or static items. Dream parlors provide entirely illusory entertainment. House Phiarlan's latest innovation is the *crystal theater*. A large device uses a tiny scrying crystal to project an image on a screen. The crystal is tied to a single location--one of the grand stages in House Phiarlan's central demesnes. This allows the patrons of a crystal theater to watch a live performance occurring on a distant stage. As this practice expands, this could provide entertainers and bards with a global reach; Phiarlan might even pay adventurers to license the rights to dramatize their exploits.

#### Cosmetic Transmutation

One form of fashion that hasn't been discussed in depth is the practice of *cosmetic transmutation*. A magewright beautician can perform a range of minor transformations--for a price. Minor cosmetic transmutation is quite common; most professional beauticians can change your hair or eye color. Unnatural effects are rarer, seen mainly in Aundair and Zilargo; metallic hair colors are a recent fad in Fairhaven, and in the days before Galifar, the nobles of Thaliost would adopt elf features. The effects of cosmetic transmutation typically last a week, but if you're dealing with a magewright of sufficient skill, you can extend the effect to one month. In some cities, you might even find an expert who can make the change permanent. The more complicated the transmutation, the more costly--and hard to find--the service becomes.

##### Cosmetic Transmutation Services
| Type            | 1 Week | 1 Month | Permanent |
|-----------------|-------:|--------:|----------:|
| Minor (natural) |  10 gp |   20 gp |     50 gp |
| Minor (unusual) |  20 gp |   40 gp |    100 gp |
| Moderate        |  40 gp |   80 gp |    200 gp |
| Major           |  60 gp |  120 gp |    300 gp |

***Minor (Natural).*** Simple transmutation can temporarily change the color of your hair, skin, or eyes within the standard parameters for your species.

***Major (Unusual).*** If you're seeking unnatural effects--cat's eyes or moving tattoos--you'll need a highly skilled beautician.

***Moderate.*** Significant physical transformation allows you to alter your weight, height, or sex. These substantial transmutations require an expert in their trade.

***Major.*** Specialized or exotic physical transformation can match the appearance of a specific individual or change your apparent species. While this alters your appearance, you don't gain the racial traits associated with your selected form. Those seeking to imitate another's appearance must be wary. Duplicating the appearance of another person is a crime under the Code of Galifar--malicious theft of identity--and even those who can perform the magic won't do so without good reason. 

It's always up to the DM to decide what services are available in any given community, and as with any magewright, beauticians are often specialized; a hairdresser might be able to give you permanent silver hair but be unable to change any other feature. In Sharn, Transmutation in Upper Tavick's Landing and The Veil of Flesh in Upper Northedge are salons that specialize in cosmetic transmutation. A House Jorasco clinic can help with gender transition, shaping muscle tone, and similar services, while the criminal Tyrants of Tavick's Landing are the masters of exotic physical transformation.

#### Transportation

The prices of transportation may seem prohibitively expensive for commoners or poor adventurers. Airship travel is new and expensive, but when traveling by elemental galleon or lightning rail more inexpensive fares are available. *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* lists a price of 5 sp per mile, which represents the finest quality of travel, equivalent to a stay at an inn of wealthy or aristocratic quality. However, the standard fare is 2 sp per mile, which is modest to comfortable in its appointments. Those on a budget can book passage in steerage for only 2 cp per mile, but this is typically squalid or poor in quality, and a long journey can be dangerous. Depending on their reputation, adventurers may also be able to exchange services for their passage, whether working as security or employing useful skills.

Similarly, the listed speeds of water and air transport represent the average rate of travel on a standard-fare vessel. Both Orien and Lyrandar have prototype vehicles capable of significantly higher speeds; however, travel on such vessels is both more expensive and dangerous.

### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones are areas where the influence of the other planes bleeds through into the Material Plane. *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* presents some possible manifest zone effects, and chapter 5 of this book explores these in more depth. Some manifest zones are dangerous, and such regions are shunned. However, other manifest zones have effects that can be quite useful for commerce or industry, and like any natural resource, these tend to be harnessed over time. The towers of Sharn are made possible by the manifest zone to Syrania, and any other city with a similar zone could support skycoaches and high towers. Lamannian manifest zones often promote fertility and growth, and many of the greatest farms and vineyards in Khorvaire are in such zones. Ultimately, this is one more factor in the wide magic of Khorvaire: it's not simply what spells can be cast, it's that there are places in the world itself that are inherently magical.

## Artificers: Invention and Innovation

![Artist: Matthew Riley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/29%20matthew%20riley.png)

Arcane magic is a science. Wizards use words of power and mystic gestures, but there are many ways to channel arcane energies--suspended in the liquid of a potion, trapped in the sigils of a scroll, or focused through a wand.

The artificer is an arcane engineer; instead of working directly with mystical energy, they use tools to perform wonders. In a world where wandslingers take to the battlefields and airships sail through the skies, artificers are innovators and inventors developing tools to shape the future. Chapter 6 presents two new artificer subclasses and a number of infusions, representing the diversity of artifice styles and specializations.

### Style of Artifice

As an artificer, you possess remarkable talents. You don't need the eldritch machines or vast resources that are traditionally involved in arcane industry, and can produce magical effects using just your personal tools. But what's the foundation of your magic? Are you building on the basic principles used by House Cannith or exploring less traditional paths of arcane science?

The Artificer Techniques table presents a few ideas. Use one of these or develop your own, considering how this affects your appearance and the way you cast your spells. Your unique style doesn't have to change any of the default rules associated with your magic. For example, you may say that you're working with principles of mundane science, but your spells will still be negated by *counterspell*. Find creative ways to explain how your character's techniques interact with game rules. Perhaps some of your theories are completely false; while you believe that you're producing magical effects by talking to spirits or using Thelanian logic, it's possible you've stumbled on a different way to trigger traditional arcane reactions. If you want to explore mechanical advantages and limitations based on your unusual techniques, discuss it with your DM.

### The Tools of Magic

When you cast an artificer spell, you follow the same rules as other spellcasters--but what are you *doing* when you use your action to produce a magical effect? You aren't praying for divine intervention, invoking a supernatural patron, or producing a fireball with words and gestures. To cast spells, you must be holding a tool you're proficient with--why? Because you're using that tool and its associated skills to produce magical effects. If you're using alchemist's supplies to cast *cure wounds*, you aren't just poking someone with a beaker; you're mixing a healing salve.

Think about what your tools actually are. Artisan's tools are an abstract concept--10 pounds of assorted objects and supplies, not just a singular tool. You may have a satchel holding them or a bandolier of pouches. If you use *tinker's tools* to create an effect, what specific tools are you using, and how? Some of the most common tools of artifice are discussed below, but you can cast spells using any artisan's tool you're familiar with. You could even perform your alchemy using *brewer's supplies* or *cook's utensils*; why drink a potion when you could eat a magical pie?

#### Alchemist's Supplies

The challenge of creating an alchemical potion is in suspending the mystical chemical reaction for later consumption. It's much easier to trigger an instant effect, and that's what you're doing when you cast your spells. Your *fire bolt* could be a thrown flask, *poison spray* is flinging foul substances. *Cure wounds*, *false life*, and *water breathing* could be potions you mix and serve on the spot. *Disguise self* or *alter self* could be magical cosmetics.

#### Calligrapher's Supplies

Sigilry channels arcane power through symbols and sound, using special inks and techniques. As with alchemy, it's much easier to produce an instant effect than to suspend and sustain it as a scroll. When you cast *fire bolt*, perhaps you use your quill to trace the name of fire in the air before you; or you might have the sigil written down and you just read it to produce the effect. Whether you draw sigils onto things or craft simple scrolls and read them, your pen is mightier than most swords.

#### Cartographer's Supplies

This is a twist on the sigilist, and you could use your tools in the same way, drawing arcane glyphs. Or, more exotically, you could specialize in calculating ley lines and the relationships between the planes. The world is filled with micro-manifest zones waiting to be triggered; you're using your tools to calculate the proper alignments to channel the planar energies you need.

#### Painter's Supplies

If you want to be fanciful about it, you could paint what you need into reality. When you cure wounds, you're literally painting over the injury; when you cast *fire bolt*, you paint the flame in the air and it flies toward your opponent. This is a variation of sigilry, but the same underlying principles apply. You might even create scrolls that are images rather than words.

#### Thieves' Tools

Artificers are proficient with both thieves' tools and tinker's tools, and you use them in similar ways. Thieves' tools include picks and other fine manipulators. You don't cast a *fire bolt* by pointing a lockpick at someone; but you could use it to clear a problematic valve on a dragon-pistol you made with tinker's tools.

#### Tinker's Tools

You can justify all manner of odd gadgets with tinker's tools, putting together a prototype that becomes part of your toolkit. A dragon-shaped sidearm could produce *fire bolt* or a modified gauntlet could deliver *shocking grasp*. These unstable prototypes can't be used by anyone else, needing constant tinkering to keep them working. So you always carry your tools, and to cast a spell, a "tool" must be in hand--but it can be a dragon-gun, as opposed to pliers. You might cast *cure wounds* using a tiny metal spider you've tinkered; while it looks like a mundane clockwork construct, magic lets it move and think. Mundane engineering is part of a tinker's creations, but magic makes them work.

#### Woodcarver's Tools

Wands, staffs, and rods are some of the most basic forms of arcane focus. If you perform magic with woodcarver's tools, you aren't actually blasting someone with a saw. Instead, you are using experimental, exotic, or temporary wands or rods. As with tinker's tools, you have to have a tool in your hand and you have to possess woodcarver's tools to perform your magic, but the exact nature of which tool is in your hand is up to you. It could appear to be a traditional wand, or you could have come up with a new revolutionary form of wand, staff, or rod.

### Spell Preparation and Infusions

As an artificer, you prepare spells during a long rest, but it's not like a wizard reading a book. It's about assembling the specialized supplies and tools you need for the things you want to do. A sigilist can't create a scroll with just any ink, but has entirely different inks based on the type of effects they're going to produce. Likewise, an alchemist prepares special reagents that combine to produce spell effects. If you use tinker's tools, you're creating and fine-tuning your gadgets. You can't create a dragon-pistol in six seconds; you prepare the pistol during your rest, and when you cast a spell, you're simply loading enchanted ammunition or triggering the arcane sigils you set in place.

This also explains the idea of spell slots. The reagents you've prepared are tricky to produce and don't last forever. You're preparing as much as you can, but once you go through all your mystic inks, you can't produce another scroll effect until you have a few hours to work on it. Effectively, your spells use temporary magic items that only you can use, created during a long rest.

Meanwhile, infusions allow you to create longer-lasting tools that you can share with your companions. Artificers create magic items, but to maintain class balance, you can't flood the party with them; it's up to you what you do with this limited resource.

### Firearms and Homunculi

Artillerists produce eldritch cannons and arcane firearms. Battle Smiths make steel defenders. Any artificer can craft a homunculus companion. But what are these? Are Artillerists wielding guns like those of our own world? Not necessarily.

These items are "arcane" and "eldritch." Much as the primary form of arcane artillery is the Siege Staff, the Artillerist uses woodcarver's tools, turning "a rod, staff, or wand into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells." So you're a specialized wandslinger with improved wands, staffs, and rods. You choose their appearance--a wand, a specialized hand crossbow, a flintlock pistol, a tiny metal dragon, or any aesthetic you like. "Arcane firearm" doesn't necessarily mean "handgun."

While the name "eldritch cannon" sounds like a massive piece of artillery, an eldritch cannon is either small or tiny, possibly small enough to hold in your hand. What does it look like, and does it have legs? Is it an animated ballista? A small siege staff? A tiny brass dragon that breathes fire on your enemies?

The same principle applies to a homunculi's appearance. Consider your style and the tools that you use for your magic. Your homunculus servant can deliver your touch spells, but how? If you use painter's supplies to perform your magic, your homunculus could be a tiny humanoid paintbrush, a floating palette, or even a creature made out of living paint. An alchemist's homunculus could be a tiny cauldron or a little humanoid creature made from glass and beakers.

Through all of these, the mechanics don't change. The shape of your arcane firearm makes no difference in combat rules; what it changes is the story that you're telling. What's interesting about your artificer? What does your homunculus say about you?

### Background Ideas

You've developed your style and chosen your tools. But how and where did you develop your skills? Do you have a connection to an established order of artificers? Consider these ways your background could reflect your experience as an artificer.

#### Wage Mage (Guild Artisan)

You worked your way up in House Cannith or the Arcane Congress, studying at a trade school and working in an industrial forgehold. While you've abandoned the factory in favor of adventure, you still have strong ties in the Fabricator's Guild.

#### Siege Engineer (Soldier)

You operated and maintained the engines of war. What nation did you serve? Are you proud of your service, or haunted by your deeds? Did you serve and retire with distinction--or are you a folk hero who deserted to help innocents?

#### Savant (Sage)

You don't do well with authority. You may have started with Arcanix or the Twelve, but you were thrown out after challenging the system one too many times. You're brilliant--but determined to find your own path.

#### Natural (Urchin)

You've never studied arcane science, but you have an intuitive talent for artifice. Perhaps you grew up on battlefields, scavenging parts from warforged titans or shattered floating fortresses. Your work isn't pretty--and often seems like it *shouldn't* work--yet you can do things no magewright can match.

#### Technical Support (Criminal/Spy)

You provided arcane assistance to an organization operating out of the public eye. Did you serve with the Royal Eyes of Aundair or the King's Citadel of Breland, crafting common items for agents? Or was it a shadier operation like the Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan? Why did you shift to a life of adventure? What pieces of your old life could come back to haunt you?

### Bastions of Artifice

If you're a guild artisan, what guild did you work with? When you buy a *wand of magic missiles* in Sharn, who made it? Here are some institutions that employ or train artificers, factions that could be tied to your background or play a role in an adventure.

#### The Arcane Congress & Arcanix (Aundair)

Throughout the golden age of Galifar, the Arcane Congress delved into magical mysteries for the good of all. Today, it only serves the people of Aundair, yet remains the largest institute of both wizardry and artifice outside of House Cannith. The Arcane Congress was largely devoted to the war effort, but it has also continued to develop common magic items and other magical tools to improve the daily life of people in Aundair.

#### The Daashor (Darguun)

The Heirs of Dhakaan maintain their own ancient tradition of artifice, which is discussed in chapters 4 and 6.

#### House Cannith (International)

House Cannith is the single largest source of artifice in the Five Nations, providing training through its trade schools and employing magewrights and artificers in its factories and forgeholds. The Fabricator's Guild creates both magical and mundane goods, while the loosely organized Tinker's Guild focuses on maintenance and repair. While Cannith has a broad range of expertise, Cannith West in Aundair excels at alchemy, Cannith South in Breland has the edge in general industry, and Cannith East specializes in artillery and dabbles in necromancy.

#### The Crucible (Thrane)

Developed during the Last War, this small order of adepts and artificers crafts items drawing on the power of the Silver Flame.

#### The Military

Every nation employed enhanced and arcane artillery in the war, along with battle magic. While most relied heavily on House Cannith, every nation has its own program researching military applications of magic, along with a corps of magewrights trained to operate artillery. Adventurers could run up against ambitious military artificers whose ambitions stretch beyond their skills.

#### Onatar's Chosen (Five Nations)

In a parallel to the cults of the Traveler, this secret order of magewrights and artificers believe they're directly inspired by the Sovereign Onatar. Members can be found scattered throughout the other organizations in this section. Onatar's Chosen believe that artifice should serve the greater good, and they seek to drive their organizations toward such positive purposes.

#### Tasker's Dream (House Sivis)

This elite think tank focuses on developing new and improved forms of communication, both through enhancing existing tools such as the speaking stone, and pioneering new techniques.

#### Traveler Cults (Five Nations)

These cults are a dark reflection of Onatar's Chosen. Followers of the Traveler are found in most organizations in this section, with a strong presence in House Cannith. Traveler cultists pursue innovation at all costs, creating weapons or tools that could shatter the existing balance of power or cause chaos in other ways. Some outsiders believe airships (which cause strife between Orien and Lyrandar) and warforged may been created by these cultists--and many blame the Traveler for the Mourning.

#### The Twelve (Karrnath)

While House Cannith is the primary source of general industry, the Twelve focuses on cooperation between all of the dragonmarked houses. The Kundarak vault network was developed here, along with most tools that draw on the specialties of multiple houses.

#### The Zil Binders (Zilargo)

The Zil elemental binding industry is an important source of magewrights and artificers, especially those following the path of planar influence. This isn't a monolithic organization; there are six major families involved in binding. The Zil consider their binding techniques to be an important national resource, and are unlikely to train anyone other than a gnome.

# Chapter 2: Races of Eberron

>>Dela ran her fingers over the marble features of the statue, a small bust of an elven woman. "She's still alive? Trapped in there?"
>>
>>"You speak as if that's a punishment." The priest's features were hidden by his golden mask, his voice calm and steady. "Our lives are filled with chaos, battling disease, searching for sustenance. And what for? When we die, all that we are is consumed by Dolurrh. Instead, she is free--from fear, from hunger, from pain. She is eternal."
>>
>>"What good's eternity trapped in stone?"
>>
>>"She lives in a world of her own creation," the priest said. "An endless trance--not unlike your dreaming, but she shapes the form of it. She may be walking through her perfect garden or reading her favorite book. She has access to all the memories of her time in her body. And that's why life is so important; it is where we gather the knowledge and memories we will use to build our eternity."
>>
>>Dela looked at the hundreds of stone faces lining the shelves. Each one the vessel of an elf soul, countless generations of the Jhaelian line. "So which one wanted to talk to me?"
>>

*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* presents statistics for four races unique to the world of Eberron: changelings, kalashtar, shifters, and warforged. This chapter delves deeper into the unique aspects of these races as well as exploring the elf culture of Aerenal. Chapter 4 also presents information on the dwarves of the Mror Holds, the ancient Dar goblinoids, the gnolls of Droaam, and the inhabitants of the Thunder Sea.

## Changelings: Embracing Change

>>"I will protect your children if they follow my path. Let them wander the world. None will know them. They will have no kingdom but the road, and no enemy will find them. They may be shunned by all, but they will never be destroyed."
>>

These are said to be the words of the Traveler, a promise that was made to the first changelings bestowed with the gift of shapeshifting. Many changelings still live according to these principles--wandering clans that remain hidden from the world. But there are an ever-increasing number of changelings who chose to live in the open. As a changeling adventurer, you may use your gifts to fool your enemies--but do you show your true face to your companions?

### Changeling Origins

Changelings are spread across Khorvaire and Sarlona. They can interbreed with many other humanoid species, and the offspring of such a union will either be changeling or the other species--there are no "half-changelings." So just as you can be a Brelish elf with no ties to Aerenal, you can be a changeling with no connection to any changeling culture or community. There are changeling students in Arcanix and Morgrave, changeling agents in the King's Citadel and the Royal Eyes of Aundair, and any number of changelings devoted to the nations they call home. So you don't *need* deep cultural ties to play a changeling character, but if you want to explore a connection to your changeling roots, here are a few ideas.

#### Travelers

Nomadic changelings are often referred to as "travelers," a name referencing both to their wandering lifestyle as well as the Traveler of the Dark Six--who, legend holds, gave them the ability to change their form, and whose chaotic nature is echoed in the lives of many travelers today.

The oldest traveler tradition is that of the Children of Jes. Inspired by the Traveler, the Children follow migratory patterns that slowly evolve, keeping them from becoming too predictable to outsiders. Many travel in small groups--a troupe of entertainers, a merchant convoy, a stagecoach of exotic travelers. Others prefer to travel alone. Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.

Few people in the Five Nations understand the culture and values held by changeling travelers. Some are unnerved by the concept of a hidden culture, that a stranger might not be the human or hobgoblin they appear to be. Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to "obtain" another's possessions as long as they're replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler's blessing is their license to prey on the "single-skins"--a term for races lacking the changeling gift for shapeshifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people--whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid--though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shapeshifting abilities and nomadic preferences.

As a player character, the changeling traveler background presented in chapter 6 can allow you to be part of a secretive network of changelings spread across the nation. As a DM, you could present the Children as a stereotypical source of thieves and charlatans. But they could be more enigmatic--an unexpected ally that can appear almost anywhere.

#### Stable Changelings

Under the rule of Galifar, many changelings chose to emerge from the shadows and live in the open, and today they can be found in most major cities of the Five Nations. Changelings in stable communities--such as Dragoneyes in Sharn or the Blackleaf district of Wroat--rarely hide their true nature. This allows them to sell their services openly and to pursue careers that make use of their unique talents, as explored in the "Changeling Careers" sidebar. However, many still make use of shared personas, and outsiders can be confused by the changelings' fluid relationship with identity. Settled changelings don't face the same level of prejudice as travelers, but there are still many single-skins who believe no changeling can be trusted.

In addition to changeling neighborhoods in the cities of the Five Nations, there are two unique changeling cultures. The Gray Tide principality of the Lhazaar Principalities is a nation of changelings with a strong mercantile tradition; some say that the Gray Tide engages in a great deal of piracy, using their shapeshifting gifts to shift the blame to other princes. In Droaam, changelings are said to have a stronghold in the city of Lost. However, no outsider knows the location of Lost, and it's said that the city itself is alive, and can freely move and change its shape. Regardless, the changelings of Lost have been strong allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell, and changelings can be found serving Daask.

As a player character, a stable background gives you a place to call home and allows you to be open about your true nature. As a DM, a changeling community can be an interesting backdrop for an adventure or an easy place to find changeling services.

> ##### Changeling Careers
>
>People often think of the shapeshifting talents of the changeling as a tool for deception. But in places where changelings live openly, including Droaam and the major cities of the Five Nations, there are many practical uses for shapeshifting. Changelings have long dominated the industry of paid companionship, using their talents to fulfill fantasies. While this can be sexual, there are many other changeling companions who specialize in giving a client the opportunity to have a meal or conversation with a distant loved one, or to practice a difficult conversation with a changeling stand-in. Many artists use changelings as versatile models. Changelings can also often be found as beauticians; in addition to possessing a deep understanding of the shifting nature of appearance, a changeling can use their own form as a palette on which to perfect the look a client is aiming for.
>
>Impersonation is also a viable career. Do you need to be in two places at once? Do you want a local celebrity to appear at your child's birthday party? Hire a changeling impersonator. The Defender's Guild of House Deneith has recently begun training and licensing elite changeling bodyguards, capable of serving as body doubles or posing as harmless bystanders until needed.
>
>Many changelings pursue a career in entertainment. After all, a changeling with the proper *shiftweave* outfit can play five roles! However, House Thuranni and House Phiarlan have been accused of denying opportunities to changelings. In licensed Phiarlan companies, changelings are typically relegated to serving as understudies and stunt doubles for dragonmarked superstars.
>

#### Passers

While changelings are well represented in the major cities, there are many villages and towns where they're treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a passer, you've crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You may live your entire life as a human warrior or an elf priest, engaging your shapeshifting abilities only as a last resort.

If you grew up as a passer, how do you live today? Do you want to learn more about other changeling cultures, or do you deny any connection to other changelings? Do you acknowledge your changeling nature, or do you consider your passer identity to be your true self? Do you pretend that your changeling abilities come from another source--claiming that your nonmagical cap is a *hat of disguise* or pretending that you're casting *disguise self* when you shapeshift?

Passer can be an interesting choice for an urchin, outlander, or a changeling who's lived through oppression and is only now coming to understand their true nature. With NPCs, passers can add an element of chaos--if a slain villain is revealed as a changeling, did they use a body double and escape, or was the villain always a passer?

#### Others

Changelings are as diverse as any other species, presenting many other cultures and paths you could explore. *Reality seekers* are settled changelings who prefer their natural form and avoid deception, instead searching for the ultimate truth. *Becomers* actively seek to live many lives in order to more fully understand the experiences of others. The Cabinet of Faces is a secret society devoted to the Traveler, and its members actively seek to challenge traditions and cause chaos. Do you have ties to any of these movements?

### Personas

For a changeling, an identity is like a set of clothes. Within a changeling community, a persona may serve the same role a badge of office or uniform would for a human. The local priest is Father Hes. The sheriff is Big Dol. The healer is Lela. Whoever takes on the job assumes that persona. There may be three different priests, but whoever is currently on duty assumes the identity of Hes. In part, this is visual, but it's also about adopting a personality--not just looking like Father Hes, but *becoming* Father Hes, giving the people a sense of continuity.

This is especially important for the traveling clans. Travelers use well-established personas as anchors in potentially hostile communities. A trusted merchant, a beloved storyteller, or a reliable mercenary--any traveler can use one of these established personas to ensure a warm welcome. Of course, when using an established persona, it's up to you to preserve its reputation. If you're exposed as a changeling or if you ruin the reputation of the persona, you're destroying a valuable tool.

Many changelings develop their own unique personas. If you're a fighter with proficiency in the violin, you might use a grim half-orc form in combat and an elegant elf when you play the violin. You're not required to use a persona--the violinist could fight in their elf form--but the persona can serve as a way to focus on that particular skill. The Focused Personas feat in chapter 6 provides a concrete reflection of this.

### Changeling Concepts

You could create a character of any class and background who just happens to be a changeling--or you can create a character whose concept is integrally tied to your identity as a changeling. Chapter 6 presents a changeling traveler background, three racial feats, and a Living Weapon monk subclass that blends shapechanging with martial discipline. However, you can have an equally interesting story with a character of any background or class, instead adjusting the "fluff"--the cosmetic details or backstory of a class--to fit an idea. While the following ideas don't require any modification to the mechanical rules of a class, it's always a good idea to discuss any exotic concept with your DM to make sure it fits the campaign.

#### The Aberrant Sorcerer

An aberrant dragonmark grants dangerous power. What if you found a way to use your natural powers to transform your mark--and in so doing, to change the powers it grants you? The Wild Magic sorcerous origin could reflect the idea that you're not entirely in control of your abilities, still learning what you can do and how to control it. Acquiring new spells might reflect your ability to reshape your mark into new configurations.

Such an ability would be unprecedented--dragonmarks resist any effort at modification or replication. If you can alter your aberrant mark's form, could you one day replicate the powers of a true mark? Does this gift mean that you have a special role to play in the Draconic Prophecy, or could your powers be part of an experiment tied to the daelkyr or a group of rogue dragons? If you take the hermit background, this could be the foundation of your Discovery feature. Whatever the truth, you'll surely be of interest to the dragonmarked houses and House Tarkanan.

#### The Changeling Changeling

In many places, it's possible to pass between Eberron and Thelanis, and countless stories are told of children stolen away by the fey. As a child, perhaps you wandered through such a portal, finding yourself in the Faerie Court. After a decade in Thelanis, you've returned as an agent of one of the mighty archfey... a changeling changeling.

This is a logical path for a warlock with an Archfey patron, and could also work with a bard (likely following the College of Glamour). Your powers reflect both the gifts of your patron and tricks you learned growing up in Thelanis. The archfey isn't just your patron, they're your surrogate family. Have you returned with a specific mission to fulfill? Or are you just reacclimatizing to the world and waiting for your purpose to be revealed?

As a changeling changeling, you're an outsider, used to living in a world of fairytale logic and still learning how the world works. The outlander background is one option, reflecting a childhood spent roaming the trackless forests of Thelanis. The hermit background is another logical choice; your Discovery could be a revelation shared with you by your patron. Another path would be to say that you returned to the Material Plane some time ago--perhaps you've earned a reputation as an entertainer by playing the music of the Feywild, or become a folk hero using your fey magic.

#### The Fraud

You've taken the noble background. You're the proud scion of a noble family... except you're not. You're a changeling body double hired by a young noble to take their place, and they never returned to take it back. It's not a bad life, you take your responsibilities seriously, and you're good at it--far better than the person you replaced. But you're not who you appear to be. How does this impact your career as an adventurer? Did you know your fellow adventurers before you became a noble fraud? Do you have an entirely separate persona you use while adventuring, or are you adventuring in the guise of the noble?

While the noble is a sound choice for this story, many other backgrounds could work as well. You were the understudy for a famous entertainer who died in a mysterious accident; now you're sought By Popular Demand, but your fame is based on someone else's face and talent. Or you could be a spy's contact now forced to complete their mission. Any class could work with this story--regardless, you've taken on someone else's identity and this comes both with benefits and grave responsibilities.

#### The Menagerie

As a changeling, you can assume the shape of any humanoid. What if you discovered that this was just a fraction of what you were capable of--that you could assume animal forms as well? As a Circle of the Moon druid, you could assert that your spells and shapechanging powers don't reflect a bond to nature, but rather an evolution of your natural abilities. Spells such as *longstrider*, *darkvision*, and *barkskin* could all be explained as evolved shapeshifting, while *charm person* or *hold person* could reflect psychic talents.

If you want to play up this idea of having druidic powers with no ties to druidic traditions, you could talk to your DM about replacing the Druidic language feature. If you take the criminal background, the DM might allow you to replace it with thieves' cant; another option would be skin cant, described in the changeling traveler background. If neither of these fit, you could likely exchange it for another uncommon language. Like the aberrant sorcerer, a changeling menagerie possesses an unusual talent. As you gain levels, you're unlocking more gifts. Are you intrigued by this mystery and what you could become? Or is your shapeshifting simply a useful tool for you?

> ##### Changeling Shapechanging
>
>As a changeling, consider that your ability to shapechange is a natural reflex for you. It doesn't have to be used for impersonation or deception. You can change your hair color or style on a whim, shift your eye color to suit your mood, even create artistic patterns on your skin. When you make a face to express an emotion, it can be any face. Are you making a rude gesture? Well, what sort of hand do you want to use to do it? Shapeshifting gives you many creative opportunities; don't be afraid to use them!
>

#### The Pantheist

The wandering priest is an easy role for the changeling traveler; pick a faith you know will receive a warm welcome in your town, preach a sermon for your supper, and move on in the morning. If you started on this path, you could have a *shiftweave* garment with vestments for the Host, the Flame, and the Blood of Vol, all ready to go. But while you may have started as a charlatan, something odd happened--you found faith. You trust that the Sovereigns are watching over you; you believe that that the Silver Flame strengthens champions of the light; when you adopt an elf form, you even feel a surge of devotion for the Undying Court. When you adopt the trappings of a faith, you feel a connection to it. You've had visions tied to every faith, and the magic flows through you. As far as you're concerned, all the faiths are real; it's just about picking the right faith for the job.

The simplest way to approach this concept is to pick a fairly general domain--such as Life--and to make your transformations largely cosmetic, a foundation for roleplaying. When you expect to be going into battle, shift your trappings to Dol Dorn. Fighting lycanthropes? Turn to the Silver Flame. About to speak to the dead? Time to call on the Blood of Vol. In taking on all these faiths, you are deeply empathetic, you accept all beliefs as valid, and you seek to help people of different faiths understand one another. Another possibility, if your DM likes the idea, is that you can receive divine visions based on the faith you're currently embodying. Adopting Onatar's trappings won't give you the mechanical benefits of the Forge domain, but you may receive a vision from the Sovereign. Again, this is purely a story idea--and it's always possible that your divine visions are just deep-rooted delusions!

## Elves of Arenal: The Deathless Kingdom

![Artist: Matthew Riley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/36%20matthew%20riley.png)

As one of the Aereni, you walk a different path than the people of Khorvaire. You were born in a realm guarded and guided by ancient and powerful spirits. You have learned lessons from teachers whose bodies died thousands of years ago, and you know that even the centuries of life that may lie ahead of you are just the beginning of your soul's journey. Your people possess arcane knowledge beyond the grasp of Aundair; the priests of the Undying Court wield powers matched only by the Keeper of the Flame. You are from a land of wonders, a realm literally guided by divine forces. In short, your people have already achieved perfection. As an Aereni elf, you aren't expected to *improve* your society; your task is to prove yourself worthy of it and to earn your afterlife.

Aereni elves have a reputation for being arrogant and condescending. Why wouldn't you be? Humans are like children to you, with their short lives and desperation to do things quickly regardless of the quality of their efforts. Even the elves that settled in Khorvaire have abandoned the traditions of their ancestors and their blessed homeland. It's easy to be smug... but who wants that character around? An Aereni elf doesn't have to be unpleasant. As one of the Aereni, you are a traveler from a mysterious and magical kingdom. You possess ancient wisdom and a tie to divine spirits. Beyond that, the Undying Court is one of the few forces in the world that has a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy. Have you come to Khorvaire as an emissary of the Undying Court, whether as a diplomat or an agent of prophecy? Are you working on behalf of a noble family, pursuing mercantile interests, or seeking an artifact stolen from your people long ago? Are you an anthropologist fascinated by the behavior of humanity? Are you a paladin in the service of the Deathguard, charged to exterminate undead wherever they can be found? Or are you an exile, driven from your homeland and forced to live among the barbarians?

Whether you play an Aereni character or encounter them as NPCs, this section provides insight into the land of the elves. In addition, chapter 6 presents a feat and subrace for Aereni elves.

### A Brief Guide to Aerenal

Aerenal is an isolated nation with little interest in the outside world. They have little fear of conquest; the divine power of the Undying Court has repelled assaults by legions of dragons. But the power of the Undying Court doesn't extend beyond Aerenal, and the elves have chosen to remain in their haven rather than to expand across the world. From this island sanctuary, they have seen the Empire of Dhakaan rise and fall, and they expect to be around long after the Five Nations have fallen to dust. Here are a few more important things to know about Aerenal.

#### The Undying Court

Aerenal is ruled by the living. The Sibling Kings lead the nation from Shae Cairdal, and the high priests and lords of the lines are mortal elves. But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to *spirit idols*, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These sprits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.

Many outsiders assume that the ascendant councilors are the Undying Court, and it's true they are the source of its power. But the Undying Court refers to *all* the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the *spirit idols*. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor--this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years--but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.

As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones--such as the one in Shae Mordai--but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn't rely on faith; there's no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people--from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive.

> ##### Spirt Idols
>
>The deathless state isn't the only way to experience eternity. Most honored dead of Aerenal are preserved in spirit idols that preserve the soul from the dissolution of Dolurrh. This stone bust of a dead elf holds relics of their corpse (bone shards, a lock of hair) embedded within it. While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance--a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A *spirit idol* can be awakened with the *speak with dead* spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.
>
>Not all Aereni want to become deathless--many consider the *spirit idol* the superior state. The deathless are sworn to protect and serve the living, and must deal with the ongoing inconvenience of physical existence; within a *spirit idol*, an elf can experience eternal peace in a dream of their own making. For many Aereni, their greatest goal in life is to gather the memories and ideas that will be their companions in their eternal trance after death.
>
>While there are more *spirit idols* than there are deathless, not all dead are preserved this way. *Spirit idols* are reserved for those who have proven worthy of eternal existence. The common dead are embalmed after death and interred in the vast catacombs below the land, along with a record of their life. Only those who have committed truly heinous crimes--such as grave robbers--are denied memory; such criminals are burned after death, their ashes scattered in the oceans, with no records kept of their lives.
>

#### A Magical Kingdom

Both arcane and divine magic are woven into Aereni civilization more deeply than in the Five Nations. Every citizen of Aerenal knows at least one useful cantrip; the skills of a master magewright in Khorvaire would be considered a mere apprentice's training in Aerenal. Here, spell effects of up to 5th level can be found woven into the fabric of everyday life. *Teleportation circles* link Aerenal's great cities, and **sending* stations* allow instant communication across any distance. Buildings are raised using the principles of *stone shape*. Diviners communicate with other planes, and healers can break curses and reverse petrification. Spell effects of up to 7th level can be encountered in the hands of master wizards and high priests, and Aereni artificers can craft very rare magic items. As you explore Khorvaire and the lands beyond, bear in mind that in your Aereni eyes, it's little more than a primitive backwater.

#### Perfection in the Past

At a glance, the people of Aerenal are simply better at everything than their counterparts in Khorvaire, due to their exceptional work ethic and long lifespan. An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren't trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan's goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters--and in Aerenal, they're still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it's a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You've never been encouraged to innovate; you've been taught that *the old ways are the best ways*. Do you agree with this?

### Noble Lines

Aerenal is effectively a collection of city-states, united in devotion to the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court. Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, "the line of Mendyrian" refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname--such as Belaereth Mendyrian--is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it's not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings--the rulers of the united kingdom--are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren't blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.

In creating an Aereni elf, work with your DM to develop details about your family and the line you owe allegiance to. Since each line is an alliance of multiple families, there's room for you to add your own details even within an existing line. A few of the noble lines are described below, but look to these as a source of inspiration rather than a limitation.

***Jhaelian.*** The line of Jhaelian governs the region around Taer Kalindal. Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the Undying Court and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many monks, clerics, and paladins, as well as many members of the Deathguard--the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down Mabaran undead. Members of this line have a tradition of using cosmetic transmutation to adopt a desiccated appearance--not unlike that of the deathless themselves--though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.

***Melideth.*** Governors of the region surrounding Pylas Talaear, the line of Melideth produces the finest sailors of Aerenal and maintains the Aereni navy. Due to its mercantile tradition, Melideth Aereni are more comfortable with foreigners than many of their kin. Facial tattoos are a common practice among the Melideth.

***Mendyrian.*** The line of Mendyrian governs the region around Shae Cairdal, and for most of Aerenal's history they have also been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings. The Mendyrian Aereni are devoted to arcane lore, and many of the most gifted wizards and artificers are Mendyrian. The Mendyrian Aereni take particular pride in their appearance, favoring ornate patterns and decoration in clothing, elaborate hairstyles, and masks of metal or leather.

***Tolaen.*** Centered around Pylas Zirinth, the line of Tolaen drives Aerenal's lumber industry, both harvesting wood for trade and producing the finest architects and wood-masons on the island. While they are devoted to the Undying Court, the Tolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts than in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen also produce many of Aerenal's soldiers and usually have good relations with the Tairnadal. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple, functional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are usually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen soldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.

***Valraea.*** All but unknown in the Five Nations, the Valraea are a line of sea elves. Their ancestors were magebred and charged to guard and govern the coastline of Aerenal. While rare, Valraea can be encountered in any of the port cities of Aerenal and are represented in the Undying Court. While Valraea characters use the sea elf subrace instead of the Aereni elf subrace presented in chapter 6, they are culturally Aereni and all the other material in this section applies to them. Valraea typically dress in leather and are comfortable with casual nudity; they fashion masks from shell and bone. More information about the Valraea Aereni can be found in chapter 4.

> ##### Aereni Names
>
>Aereni names tend to be multiple syllables, and commonly contain the ae diphthong. With foreigners, Aereni often use only their personal name and identify their line; surnames are generally used in introductions to other elves. Only members of the noble line will use the name of their line as a surname.
>
>- **Male:** Aeren, Belaereth, Carden, Dalaer, Dayne, Helaeras, Jhalaer, Jhayne, Maeran, Mazareth, Mayne, Shaeras, Taen, Thaendyr, Tolan, Varaendyr, Varonen
>- **Female:** Aeren, Ashaelyn, Erandis, Etrigani, Heladaen, Jhalira, Laeren, Mazalira, Minaera, Serandis, Syraen, Taelira, Tazaera, Thaera, Vadallia, Vaeren
>- **Surnames:** Alaraen, Alorenthi, Daelian, Dyraen, Halaen, Jholareth, Jholyr, Maloraen, Mendaen, Mol, Shialaen, Shol, Tolarenthi

The line of Vol once governed the region around Shae Deseir, but that line was broken and all ties to the bloodlines bearing the Mark of Death were eliminated thousands of years ago. There are many other noble lines among the Aereni, and you are free to create your own as called for by your story.

In creating an Aereni character, how does your heritage impact you? What line are you tied to and who's your family? Are they respected? Do you respect your leaders? What's one unusual custom tied to your line? Do you aspire to join the noble line?

### Mentors

As an Aereni elf, you aren't considered an adult until you've passed your first century. During that time, you undergo deep schooling in the traditions of your line and your chosen profession. If you're using the Aereni elf subrace presented in chapter 6, this is when you develop your Aereni Expertise and learn your cantrip. A century is a long time, and you've surely developed important relationships in your youth. In creating your character, work with your DM to establish a mentor--an NPC who played a particularly critical role in your early life.

The Aereni Mentors table provides ideas for developing a mentor. Consider whether they play an ongoing role in your life or were simply a vital inspiration. Are you now working on behalf of your mentor? Are you hoping to solve a mystery for them? To find something they need? To somehow clear their name or vindicate their beliefs? Are you your mentor's protégé or favored student, or are you driven by the fact that you disappointed them and were banished from their company? Perhaps you have a rival who betrayed your mentor--or stole your place with them!

### Aereni Quirks

In creating an Aereni character, consider the following.

***Hidden Faces.*** The Aereni often alter their features following the traditions of their ancestors or their line. Jhaelian Aereni mortify their flesh to appear deathless even while alive. Melideth Aereni favor facial tattoos, often of skulls or other gothic images. All of the lines have distinctive masks, whether of metal, wood, or leather, worn by agents of the line when conducting official business. Likewise, priests of the Undying Court wear the golden mask of the Court when acting in its service. Do you wear a mask, have tattoos, or other cosmetic alterations?

***Perfect Technique.*** Aereni are obsessed with tradition--not simply mastering a skill, but performing it in the perfect style of ancient masters. Where Aundair encourages aspiring wizards to develop their own unique style for incantations and gestures, an Aereni wizard spends a decade perfecting their diction then another mastering somatic gestures. Aereni spellcasting isn't just functional, it's beautiful. In describing your actions, add details about the grace and artistry of your movements. Namedrop the ancient elves who developed the techniques you're using today. When you begin using a new ability that you just acquired after gaining a level, your in-character explanation could be that you've been practicing this spell for five years, and only just perfected it.

***Tradition verses Innovation.*** The Aereni cling to the past rather than looking to the future. Do you do the same? Are you working to master the techniques of your ancestors, to find lost artifacts of your line, or are you challenging tradition? Perhaps you have an entirely new idea that you feel could change Aerenal and earn you a place in the Undying Court--but you've left Aerenal so you can master it without being discouraged by those who dwell in the past. Or perhaps you don't yet have a new idea, but you're convinced that your people need to move forward, and you're exploring different lands in search of inspiration.

***New in Town?.*** If you're a recent arrival to Khorvaire, you might make a few mistakes based on your experience in your homeland. You could suggest that a priest of the Sovereign Host request an audience with Aureon; after all, *you* could visit your gods in Shae Mordai for important matters. If a historical figure comes up in conversation, you could suggest speaking with them; surely Galifar or Mishann would be preserved as spirit idols. What kind of fools would let important souls be lost? What do you mean, we can't just teleport from Sharn to Korth?

***Vampires Suck.*** As Aereni, you're used to living with the dead, but those deathless are sustained with positive energy. In contrast, the Undying Court teaches that Mabaran undead--negative-energy undead, from skeletons and zombies to liches and vampires--are inherently destructive. Beyond the fact that many of them prey on the living to survive, they're conduits to Mabar and drain the ambient life from the world simply by existing. It may not be provable, but you believe it's a concrete environmental threat--have you noticed plants tend to die in places with lots of undead? As someone who's going to live a long time, your people take these things seriously. While you can put up with their presence if a situation absolutely requires it, you likely consider negative undead a serious threat.

### Aereni Backgrounds

As an Aereni elf in Khorvaire, you're far from home. Are you an exile, an emissary, or a simple tourist? Here are some ways your background might affect your character's new life.

***Acolyte.*** As an acolyte, you're a recognized servant of the Undying Court. Temples of the Undying Court are rare in Khorvaire, but they can be found in major cities. Beyond this, you can request minor assistance from any Aereni; they won't place themselves in danger, but they'll show respect and support you.

***Charlatan and Criminal.*** Crime is rare in Aerenal, but these backgrounds can reflect a connection to criminal organizations in Khorvaire. This could be something your family developed for business. It could be tied to your personal history, especially if you're an exile from Aerenal. Or you could be an agent of the Cairdal Blades--one of their spies--in which case you might be using criminal connections as a source of information.

***Entertainer.*** As an entertainer, your Popular Demand feature could reflect your reputation in Aerenal, Khorvaire, or both. Are your performances tied to the traditions of your ancestors or are you creating something new? Are you willing to work with House Phiarlan or House Thuranni--who will want to license any popular act--or do you despise the dragonmarked for abandoning Aerenal, refusing to work with them?

***Folk Hero.*** Being considered a folk hero in Aerenal won't do you much good if you're adventuring in Khorvaire. The question is what you've done *since* arriving in Khorvaire to earn this reputation... and just as important, why. What is it that would drive you to fight for the common people of a distant land? Is it tied to the reason you left Aerenal? Are you just an altruist, or have you carefully constructed your identity as a folk hero as part of some grand design that could take a century to bear fruit?

***Hermit and Sage.*** Both of these are sound paths for Aereni. An Aereni scholar could make an excellent sage. As a hermit, you may have had a vision from the Undying Court or a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy that has led you to distant lands.

***Noble.*** As a member of a noble line, you weren't born to your position, you were raised into it. What did you do to earn this honor? You're seen as one of the most promising members of your line, but you're also expected to serve the interests of your line and your people; do you embrace this duty? While you may not be a noble of the Five Nations, most of the nations of Khorvaire show great respect to Aereni nobles, and your Position of Privilege should still open doors in high society

***Sailor.*** The line of Melideth are the sailors of the Aereni. While Aerenal has little interest in exploration and remained neutral in the Last War, Melideth traders can be found across the seas.

***Soldier.*** You may have served in the armed forces of your line, or you might be a member of the Deathguard, the elite military force tasked to eliminate negative undead (a logical background for a cleric or paladin). Your rank will likely be recognized by any loyal citizen of Aerenal. While you have no authority in the Five Nations, officers may at least respect you as a fellow soldier. On the other hand, as an elf, you've had a long life; it could be that you left Aerenal a decade or two ago and served with one of the Five Nations. If so, what drew you into the war? How does your family feel about your actions?

The far traveler and inheritor backgrounds from the *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide* are sound choices for an Aereni elf. The haunted one background from *Curse of Strahd* could reflect something you saw in the Mabaran manifest zones of your homeland--or you could be literally haunted by an ancestor.

> ##### What About the Tairnadal?
>
>The Aereni are the dominant culture of Aerenal. The Tairnadal are a separate culture that came to Aerenal during the exodus and laid claim to the northern steppes. Rather than preserving their ancestors as deathless or *spirit idols*, the Tairnadal believe they anchor their ancestors by emulating their heroic deeds.
>
>The Tairnadal have a long alliance with the Aereni and fight alongside their cousins when the island is threatened. It's possible for elves to immigrate from one culture to another; the line of Tolaen is known for having close ties to the Tairnadal. But they're separate cultures; the Tairnadal don't worship the Undying Court and its warriors don't become deathless.

## Kalashtar: Between Two Worlds

![Artist: Kristof Koteles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/40%20kristof%20koteles.png)

You were born with a bond to an otherworldly being. You have memories of a life you've never lived, visions of battling fiends and an endless struggle against darkness. When you sleep, you don't dream as others do, but you often wake with a sense of purpose or new ideas. You see the pain and suffering in the world and know that there is a path to light--but there are monsters in the shadows, faceless enemies that have been hunting you since before you were born.

Will you embrace the spirit within you and make its struggle your own? Will you stand against the darkness, even if it draws the many eyes of the Dreaming Dark upon you? Or will you ignore that inner voice and try to live your own life?

### Kalashtar Origins

The quori are spirits of nightmare. But just as angels can fall, fiends can rise. Centuries ago, a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that dominates Dal Quor. The Dreaming Dark hunted them across the dreamscape, seeking to consume and reclaim them. In desperation, these rebel spirits reached out to Eberron, finding a haven in the minds and bodies of a group of Adaran monks. Sixty-seven spirits escaped, and the first kalashtar were born.

As a kalashtar, you're descended from one of these monks. A quori is bound to your bloodline. It exists in the minds and dreams of all of your siblings, and as long as one of you is alive the quori is sustained. Should you all die, the spirit will be lost... and so, the Dreaming Dark is always happy to kill a kalashtar.

The kalashtar were born centuries ago, and have since spread out from Adar. What is your background? What has set you on the path to adventure? Are you searching for allies against the Dreaming Dark, or are you pursuing a mission of your own?

#### Adaran

The kalashtar were born in Sarlona, in the distant land of Adar. Today, the Empire of Riedra dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and il-Lashtavar won't be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light.

Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. If you are from Adar, what caused you to leave your monastery and brave the Riedran blockades? Have the elders entrusted you with a specific mission, or has your quori spirit driven you to distant lands? The hermit background is a good way to reflect a mystic from a distant land possessing dangerous revelations.

Of all the origins mentioned here, you likely have the strongest connection to your quori spirit. Adaran kalashtar are ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. You were taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness; can you reconcile this with your adventuring life? If you've recently arrived in Khorvaire after living your life in a monastery, you are unaccustomed to crime and greed. Is the chaos of a city like Sharn disorienting?

#### Khorvairian

There are kalashtar communities in several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. Kalashtar prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. If you were raised in such a community, you're familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs. But there's no Riedran army at the gates; you know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it's a ghost in the shadows.

Many kalashtar simply seek to spread light through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes. On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don't believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and to ruthlessly eliminate them. While a Shadow Watcher's focus is on agents of the Dreaming Dark, they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.

As a kalashtar of Khorvaire, you could bring a compassionate approach to any background; whether you're an acolyte of the Path of Light, a wise sage, or a lively entertainer, you do your best to help the innocent and lift spirits. Criminal and charlatan would be unusual paths, but the spy background could reflect the work of a Shadow Watcher. While you aren't as isolated from the world as an Adaran kalashtar, you're still guided by alien instincts and have an otherworldly demeanor.

#### Orphan

Kalashtar can breed with humans and half-elves, and their children have an equal chance of being fully kalashtar or the race of the other parent. Kalashtar are quite rare; even in cities like Sharn with kalashtar communities, there are many people who will assume kalashtar are just humans with strange eyes... or some sort of half-elf, maybe? Maybe it's a new fashion?

As such, there are kalashtar in Khorvaire who grew up without the guidance of a kalashtar parent. Orphans may be entirely unaware of their heritage and the nature of their quori spirit--it tries to communicate through dream-visions and instincts, but lacking any context, such orphans rarely understand their quori bond. Nonetheless, the quori is an integral part of them, urging them toward the light--and indeed, most orphans follow such a path. A kalashtar orphan who chooses a darker path is fighting the instincts imparted by their spirit. Such a kalashtar is likely to be deeply conflicted, which can manifest as unidentified stress, fits of rage, depression, or unpredictable behavior.

An orphan kalashtar can follow any path. Whether altruistic, nefarious, or somewhere in between, work with your DM to decide how you interpret the influence of your quori bond. Have you followed its guidance despite not knowing its true nature? Do you interpret it as a curse or ghost, twisting your thoughts and putting you at odds with yourself? Have you found the inner determination to suppress it entirely? Do you ultimately want to come to terms with your kalashtar nature, or do you like being an outsider and prefer to stay that way?

### The Quori Bond

As a kalashtar, you're part of a spiritual lineage, traditionally reflected by the suffix of your name. For example, Lanhareth and Minhareth are both kalashtar of the lineage of Hareth. Your lineage is set before birth, tied to one of your parents. If you are born to kalashtar of Vaktri and Hareth, you inherit only one of the bonds, often that of the parent of your gender. Since you can't inherit both bonds, you won't be half Hareth and half Vaktri. Your lineage affects your appearance and personality, eye color, hair color, and other aspects. When you meet another kalashtar of your lineage, you'll see common traits, but you'll also feel a deeper connection; in some ways, you're one person.

The quori bond exists on a deep level. Your quori doesn't hover over your shoulder or whisper in your ear. Instead, it exists in the collective subconscious of all kalashtar of your lineage, shaping and guiding you all. You feel it as instinct, in memories of things you've never done--visions of a war in the realm of dreams. When you sleep, you don't dream, but the bond grows stronger. Your quori may even give visions to guide you. With time and training, you can strengthen this connection, learning to hear its psychic voice more clearly; the Quori Bond feat presented in chapter 6 is one way to reflect this stronger bond. Ultimately, it's up to you how you roleplay your connection. While the quori isn't an active presence that responds in conversation, some kalashtar do speak to it as if it was, talking with the quori as a way of processing their own thoughts. Others take comfort in its subconscious presence, confident it is with them at all times. And some--notably orphans--refuse to acknowledge it, determined to see their mind as their own.

In creating a kalashtar character, it's important to consider what type of quori you're bound to. You can develop this through roleplaying, but it can also be reflected by your choice of class and by your abilities or spells. Each quori has a connection to a particular emotion. Fiendish quori feed on this emotion, using it to manipulate mortals. In your case, it could be that you understand how to generate that emotion in others, or that you yourself experience that emotion in a deep and powerful way. Or it could be that you have learned how to suppress that emotion, and that is the source of your strength. Whatever choice you make, it will be reflected throughout your lineage. If you decide that Vaktri is a du'ulora quori and that you draw on his burning fury to produce your own barbarian rage, then other Vaktri kalashtar you meet may also be barbarians or furious warriors.

The three quori presented in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* are described below, along with another fourth common quori, the du'ulora, whose statistics are presented in chapter 8. If you want to develop a kalashtar from another quori lineage, discuss it with your DM.

#### Du'ulora

The fiendish du'ulora are spirits of rage and aggression. In Dal Quor, they craft dreams that drive feuds and vendettas, spurring mortals to violence and vengeance. Your du'ulora spirit has turned against the darkness, but fury remains its domain and anger is your birthright. How do you express this? As a bard, you might specialize in taunting enemies, turning their anger against them and driving them to rash action. As a barbarian, you could say that your spirit is the source of your rage. As a paladin, you might channel its fury when you smite your foes. You might be calm and serene most of the time, expressing sudden powerful moments of rage when you draw on your bond.

The key thing to remember is that your du'ulora has chosen the path of light, even if it is a spirit of rage. You may revel in moments when you get to unleash your anger on your enemies, but it still drives you to fight for a noble cause. Your fury is a tool, and you should never let it drag you into darkness.

#### Hashalaq

The hashalaq are seducers and deceivers, feeding on doubt and desire. They are the spies and loremasters of the quori. Hashalaq kalashtar make excellent bards; the College of Lore reflects both your love of knowledge and your ability to confuse your foes. Hashalaq make excellent warlocks, with your spirit granting the Beguiling Influence invocation and allowing you to charm your enemies. As a hashalaq kalashtar, consider whether you specialize in deception, or choose to be honest and focus on your ability to inspire positive emotion--do you prefer cunning Deception or empathic Persuasion? Hashalaq clerics typically follow this latter path, using their knowledge to guide allies and cut through the deception that comes so naturally to their kind.

#### Kalaraq

The kalaraq are spirits of pride and ambition. The natural leaders of the quori, they dominate through sheer charisma and force of will. As a kalaraq kalashtar, you surely have your own grand ambitions. You excel at inspiring others to follow you and you won't hesitate to take bold action. You might lead in the vanguard as a paladin, or strengthen your allies as a cleric, or bend enemies to your will as a bard of the College of Glamour. The kalaraq are also known as the eyebinders, capable of consuming and binding weak souls; you could be a warlock or wizard who specializes in summoning or binding spirits.

The kalaraq are the rarest and most powerful of the quori. The kalaraq Taratai was the leader of the rebels, and hers is the only spiritual lineage that has been completely destroyed by Dreaming Dark; Taratai's own fate is unknown. There are only a couple remaining kalaraq lines, and as a kalaraq kalashtar, others may look to you for bold leadership and guidance.

#### Tsucora

The tsucora feed on terror and craft the most classic nightmares. As a tsucora kalashtar, you have a deep understanding of fear. This is an excellent foundation for a bard of the College of Whispers or a Living Weapon monk (in chapter 6), sowing fear with a word or a touch. Likewise, you could be a Great Old One warlock tormenting your enemies with fear and dissonant whispers. On the other hand, you could take the path of an inspiring cleric who bolsters your allies against fear, using your knowledge of it to strengthen their resolve. Tsucora kalashtar often seem cold and intimidating, but despite your knowledge of nightmares, you are still looking toward the light.

### Psychic Power

Kalashtar are known for their psychic gifts, but aside from their Mind Link, how does this manifest in a kalashtar character? In fifth edition, how do they wield mental power? Chapter 6 presents a Mind Domain cleric and two kalashtar racial feats. In addition, characters carry an innate sense of mental discipline--a kalashtar monk could consider ki as a representation of psionic ability, and the Living Weapon monastic tradition in chapter 6 builds on this. But you can also change the flavor of a class without altering the mechanics. Consider the following ideas.

#### Bards

Many kalashtar seek to fight evil through inspiration, and the bard can be an excellent foundation for this. While Bardic Inspiration is described as "stirring words or music," you can describe your actions as being tied to psychic gifts; instead of a mystical song, you could describe your inspiration as a word backed by a surge of psychic energy. When you use the Words of Terror of the College of Whispers or the Cutting Words of the College of Lore, this could easily reflect your powers of psychic manipulation. Likewise, your spellcasting is mechanically magic; it can be counterspelled, it won't work in an *antimagic field*, and so on. But you can easily describe *vicious mockery* or *crown of madness* as psychic attacks, or present *cure wounds* as a psychometabolic effect, using your mind to knit together the wounds of another. You gain no mechanical advantage from this--in the case of Bardic Inspiration, your target still has to be able to hear you, even if you're using psychic power--but there's nothing preventing you from presenting your bard as being psychically gifted as opposed to singing magic songs.

#### Clerics and Paladins

Most kalashtar are devoted to the Path of Light, and though its faithful worship no gods, the faith itself can be a source of divine magic. Priests of the Path of Light say that the faithful are inspired by il-Yannah--the great light that will one day rise to replace the Dreaming Dark--but their power comes from within. As such, both cleric and paladin are logical paths for a kalashtar, and you can add psychic flavor to your spells as described with the bard above. When you cast *command*, you aren't demanding your victim bow to il-Yannah; instead, il-Yannah is strengthening your mind and allowing you to impose your will on the target. Effects such as *bless* could reflect your ongoing psychic guidance, while *cure wounds* and similar spells could be psychometabolic. Your faith helps you focus your mind, but it's your mind that generates the power. If you want to take this farther, the Mind domain presented in chapter 6 allows you to replace radiant damage with psychic damage; thus, you can flavor your *sacred flame* as a psionic blast instead of holy fire.

This same concept can work for a Divine Soul sorcerer. You don't use the trappings of a priest, but your visions of il-Yannah have allowed you to focus your mind and alter reality. You can select spells that feel like they could be psychic powers; when you cast mage hand, it can be flavored as an act of telekinesis.

#### Warlock

You can simply describe your warlock spells as being drawn from psychic power as opposed to arcane invocations. Your patron is your quori spirit. As a warlock, you might have an especially strong bond to this spirit and receive clearer visions than most kalashtar of your lineage; traditionally, kalashtar with such a strong connection are called atavists. The Great Old One is an easy choice, as many of its spells reflect mental manipulation; you can describe *Evard's black tentacles* as ectoplasmic projections, or *armor of Agathys* as a blend of telekinetic force and cryokinesis. The Awakened Mind feature soon becomes obsolete due to Mind Link; a DM could choose to combine the two, increasing the range of a kalashtar warlock's Mind Link feature by 30 feet. The Celestial patron is another logical choice, focusing on your quori as a spirit of light. As a Hexblade or any warlock using the Pact of the Blade, you can describe your weapon as being forged from nightmares.

If you want to add more psionic flavor to your warlock, your DM might allow you to shift the damage type of a few of your spells; could *eldritch blast* inflict psychic damage? And even with default rules, you can roleplay it as a burst of telekinetic force.

> ##### Creating a Lineage
>
>Once you've chosen a quori spirit, next define your lineage, considering the traits you might share with other kalashtar bound to that same quori line. Here are two examples.
>
>**Lurashtai** began her existence as a tsucora quori. She wove dreams of gothic horror, playing on her victims' fears of death and the undead. Raised on these morbid memories, the kalashtar of her line are comfortable with tragedy, have no fear of death, and see beauty in things that others find disturbing or terrifying. As a spirit of light, Lurashtai has taken an interest in the undead; she fears that by being trapped outside the cycle of life and dream, the undead weaken the shared soul of the age. As a result, the kalashtar of her line are often driven to hunt undead and lay their spirits to rest. Lurashtai kalashtar usually have pale complexions, sharp features, and silky, dark hair; they generally favor the color red in their clothing.
>
>**Aveth**, a hashalaq quori, wielded the twin weapons of manipulation and insight before his exodus from Dal Quor. He takes great interest in the potential that mortals hold to choose a nobler path, much as he and his kind fled Darkness in search of Light. The kalashtar of Aveth's line prefer following their intuition over the careful planning of others. They have great confidence in their ability to win over potential foes, turning them into friends, which can yield unexpected allies--or the untimely death of the too-optimistic kalashtar. Aveth kalashtar usually have dark skin, black hair, a preference for blue and aquamarine, and a distinct dislike of peanuts.

## Shifters: Wild and Wary

![Artist: Mariana Suarez Otero](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/43%20mariana%20suarez%20otero.png)

As a shifter adventurer, you walk a path between the wilds and the civilized world. You are driven by primal instincts, the whispers of Wolf or Rat. When you embrace those voices, you transform. Do you see your shift-form as your true self, reveling in these moments of primal ascension? Or do you hate shifting, fearing that you might one day lose yourself to the beast within?

In creating a shifter, consider your roots and the spirit that drives you. What has set you on the path to adventure? Do you embrace the party as your pack, or are your companions just the means to an end?

### Shifter Origins

Shifters are relatively rare in the Five Nations; there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters. The bulk of the shifter population of Khorvaire is based in the Towering Wood, the vast forest that stretches across the northwest. Over the last four decades, shifters have emerged from the deep woods to live in the farmlands of the Eldeen Reaches, shaping the culture of this new nation. Outside the Towering Wood, many shifters fled the violence and persecution of the Silver Crusade, leading to their scattering across the Five Nations. While the hysteria of the Silver Crusade has long since died down, there are still many who treat shifters with fear or suspicion. *They're weretouched, more beast than human. They're prone to violence--they can't help it. Don't they become dangerous when the moons are full?*

As a shifter character, you don't have to be tied to a shifter community. You could've grown up in the Five Nations, serving as a soldier or working for a dragonmarked houses just as anyone else might have. But if you want deeper ties, consider the following options.

#### Deep Forest

The shifters of the Towering Wood, nomadic hunter-gatherers, follow the same traditions that have sustained their people for millennia. Their champions are druids, rangers, and barbarians, and they are attuned to the beast within. But they know almost nothing about the world beyond the wood and have little experience with artifice or the wonders of the dragonmarked houses. If you're from such a tribe, what drove you to leave the woods? Are you following a druidic prophecy? Pursuing an ancient evil that's escaped from the wood? Have you been exiled from your tribe, or are you simply driven by curiosity? Outlander and hermit are both logical backgrounds for such a character.

#### Eldeen Reaches

Shifters played a strong role in the rise of the Eldeen Reaches. They can be found in the Warden militia, and many have settled in the farmlands, integrating with the other races in the area. The Reaches are a young nation that broke free from Aundair during the Last War, and there's considerable fear that Aundair may try to reclaim the region. As an Eldeen shifter, are you a proud Reacher? Do you stand up for your people and take an aggressive stance against Aundair? Are your actions in some way helping your family? Or have you turned your back on the Reaches? Any background can work for an Eldeen shifter, but folk hero and outlander are both strong options.

#### Urban Pack

Due to the fear and prejudice of many strangers, shifters often form tight communities in the larger cities. Lower Northedge in Sharn holds most of the city's shifters; as a child, you might have played hrazhak on the bridges or pissed on the shrine of Fathen the Martyr. Do you have ties to an extended family in a bad part of town, or are you a lone wolf? Did you serve in the Last War, and if so, was it a sign of devotion to your nation or were you just doing your job? Do you cling to any of the old traditions of the woods, or do you see stories of Grandmother Wolf as foolish superstition?

### The Beast Within

Your shifter subrace isn't driven by genetics--two beasthide shifters can have a swiftstride child. Young shifters have the same general phenotype, but as a child you find your beast within; this sets your subrace, triggering physical and psychological changes. The tribes of the Towering Wood believe that these beasts are totem spirits; Moonspeaker Druids tell stories of Grandmother Wolf and Grandfather Rat, and shifter hunters may swear by Tiger's Blood.

Your beast within is reflected by your subrace and shapes your personality and appearance. If your beast is the Tiger, you likely have feline features, which are exaggerated when you shift. However, the beast is ultimately a reflection of who you are; you can attribute your wild temper to your Boar nature, but it's not a truly independent force like the quori spirits of the kalashtar.

Moonspeaker druids respect many spirits, but the following five are usually associated with the beast within:

- The **Bear** embodies strength and caution; in contrast to the Boar, the Bear pauses before taking rash action. Shifters tied to the Bear are typically beasthide.
- The **Boar** possesses great endurance and is celebrated for its honesty and lack of guile; however, it is also seen as being reckless and overly enthusiastic, often prone to rash action. Boar shifters are typically beasthide.
- The **Rat** is clever and stealthy. Lacking physical strength, Grandfather Rat uses wits to overcome his enemies. Rat shifters are usually swiftstride, but can also be wildhunt.
- The **Tiger** is known for grace and speed, seen as a valiant hunter. In contrast to those guided by the Wolf or Rat, those touched by Tiger tend to be loners. Tigers are usually swiftstride or wildhunt.
- The **Wolf** is considered wise and honorable, the pillar of a community and keeper of the druidic mysteries. Wolf shifters with a martial bent tend to be longtooth shifters, while druids guided by Grandmother Wolf are usually wildhunt.

Chapter 6 presents two character options that can represent your connection to the beast within, including the Superior Shifting racial feat and the Way of the Living Weapon monastic tradition. In creating a shifter character, consider both the nature of your beast within and how you relate to it. If you're a wildhunt shifter with lupine characteristics, do you think of yourself as being touched by Grandmother Wolf? Do you play up this aspect of your personality, or do you largely try to ignore it?

### Shifters and Lycanthropes

Shifters and lycanthropes are clearly related. Both transform into a more bestial state. Shifters have affinities for bear, boar, rat, and wolf; could it be mere coincidence that these are the most common forms of lycanthrope? And yet, the differences between shifter and lycanthrope are vast. Being a shifter isn't a condition that can be passed by a bite. Shifters have full control over their gifts, while lycanthropes struggle with them. The beast within may shape a shifter's personality, but it doesn't overwhelm it. By contrast, lycanthropy attempts to destroy the victim's original personality and can turn the most virtuous hero into a bloodthirsty murderer. Wererats and werewolves are cruel killers... but Grandmother Wolf doesn't encourage savagery, and Grandfather Rat doesn't urge murder. And perhaps most important of all: shifters themselves can become lycanthropes. This isn't in their blood; lycanthropy is a curse, and it can afflict them just like it can any other humanoid.

The Moonspeaker druids tell a tale of five shifter champions who ventured too deep into the Towering Woods. They hunted a great evil, but when they caught it, they were overwhelmed; its evil filled their hearts, and it sent them back to prey on their friends and families. If anyone survived their attacks, the evil would seep through the wound and poison their hearts as well. These, they say, were the first lycanthropes.

The Silver Crusade began when a dark power surged in the Towering Wood, amplifying the power of lycanthropy. The curse became more virulent. Victims fell prey to its power more quickly, guided by some dark power beyond the common evil of the curse. Within the Towering Woods, tribes of shifters fought their corrupted kin. Beyond it, the farmers of Aundair were tormented by raiding wolves and boars. When the templars responded, the beasts that were slain reverted to their natural forms, revealing that they were shifters. The word quickly spread: all shifters were weretouched, capable of turning into savage beasts. None could be trusted! Meanwhile, among the shifter tribes, scouts warned of atrocities committed by the foreign soldiers. In fact, the demagogues on both sides were wererats working to ensure that these possible allies would instead become bitter enemies... and the trick worked. Frightened templars and paranoid mobs slew many innocent shifters, and to this day the extremist sect known as the Pure Flame claims all shifters are servants of darkness.

The fact of the matter is that *lycanthropy is a weapon*; it spreads through violence and turns its victims into killers. Its origins may never be discovered, but the Moonspeaker tale is as logical as any. Lycanthropes and shifters are related in that the first lycanthropes were cursed shifters. The unknown force responsible was likely also behind the surge that caused the Silver Crusade--and it could rise again. One logical contender is the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. It's said that Dyrrn created doppelgangers by twisting changelings; it could have used this same technique to create lycanthropes from shifters. Or it could have been the work of an overlord, an archfiend of the Age of Demons; some texts speak of the Wild Heart, an overlord who destroys civilizations and feeds on primal cruelty. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if the answer will be revealed, and if so, what it is. In battling the cults of the Dragon Below, could you face the original shifter champions corrupted by Dyrrn? Or might the schemes of the Lords of Dust unleash the Wild Heart?

While shifters and lycanthropes aren't the same, the story and the stereotype is well established. Everyone calls the shifters "weretouched." Beyond the Towering Woods, there are many shifters who indeed believe they are thin-blooded lycanthropes. And the wounds caused by the Silver Crusade and the Pure Flame will never completely heal. But despite the stereotype, the shifters of the Towering Woods fear and fight evil lycanthropes, and their tribes include Monster Slayer rangers who specialize in hunting werewolves. Shifters and lycanthropes resemble one another, but they are not the same--and shifters are just as vulnerable to the curse of lycanthropy as humans are.

> ##### Shifters and Totems
>
>The Totem Warrior barbarian and the Circle of the Shepherd druid are both strong choices for a shifter character. But how do the totem options overlap with your ties to the beast within? If you decide that you're a beasthide shifter with a Bear spirit, can you take Wolf as your Totem Spirit feature? Of course you can--even as a Totem Warrior, you're not bound to a single totemic beast. You could play up the idea that you feel a connection to multiple spirits. With your DM's approval, you could even have your character develop physical traits tied to your second spirit; you've always been a big, bearlike warrior, but now you manifest lupine ears and fangs when you shift.
>
>Another option is to rename your class features to match your beast within. There's no reason you can't take the Bear option for the Totem Spirit feature but call it "Boar" instead. There is no Rat option for a Totem Warrior, but you could take the Eagle option and call it Rat. Ultimately this is a question of story. If you want to highlight your tie to a single spirit and it makes sense, just change the names. But there's nothing wrong with having a totem menagerie!

## Warforged: Steel and Soul

![Artist: Olie Boldador](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/45%20olie%20boldador.png)

As a warforged, your body was made in a Cannith forgehold. The creation forge wove rootlike muscles across a frame of metal and darkwood, bathing your body in alchemical fluids, giving you skin of steel or hardened leather. And then the miracle occurred: you came to life. You are made from wood and steel, but you are *alive*, aware, capable of feeling love and anger. You were born with an innate sense of your purpose, the knowledge of war burned into the back of your mind. But you aren't bound to follow the path that your creators planned for you. You have freedom. You have the ability to learn. Perhaps you even have a soul.

As a warforged, you were created for a reason--what was it? How did you find a new purpose and become an adventurer? What do you want from life now? Are you concerned about the fate of the warforged as a species, or do you feel more of a kinship with your adventuring companions than you do with other warforged?

### Origin and Purpose

The first warforged were built for battle. As Cannith refined its techniques, what started as simple infantry gave way to more sophisticated designs: lithe scouts with mithral plating, powerful juggernauts, even "living wands" wielding the power of sorcerers. As people grew more accustomed to these living constructs, Cannith began designing civilian warforged with a wide array of talents.

As a warforged, you have the ability to learn, and your background and class features could reflect this. If you're a warforged bard, were you built to entertain, or were you created as a simple laborer only to discover remarkable talent within yourself? If you're a sorcerer, were you designed to channel arcane power, or is it an unexpected development? Determine your original purpose from the options below, then consider how it relates to who you are today.

#### Battlefield

Like most warforged, you were designed to serve in the Last War. You didn't choose your side; you were sold to one of the Five Nations and set to work. You weren't taught to question this role--war was the only purpose you knew. Some warforged came to feel a patriotic attachment to the nation they served, despising the enemies they fought. Others felt a close bond to the officers and soldiers they served with, fighting for this "family" rather than for a nation. How about you? Which nation did you fight for? Do you consider yourself to be a Thrane or a Cyran, or do you have no love for the nation that bought you and threw you on the front lines?

Warforged were in service for the last three decades of the war. How long did you serve? What was your most dramatic experience? Did combat leave you with lasting scars or damage, even if they have no mechanical effect on your character?

For many warforged, class abilities reflect the role you played on the battlefield. As a fighter, you likely fought in the vanguard. As a ranger or rogue, you may have been designed as a scout. A barbarian's rage could reflect a "battle mode"--you don't actually get angry, but you temporarily increase your damage output and resistance. Class abilities gained over time could reflect an evolution of that design as you unlock your full potential--is this true for you, or are you developing unexpected talents?

#### Civilian

In the last decade of the Last War, Cannith began selling warforged to civilian organizations. This wasn't a common thing; a farmer couldn't just go to the shop and take a warforged home. But you could have served a dragonmarked house, been a bodyguard or a tutor for a noble family, or even been designed to serve as an enforcer for a criminal organization. This path provides a wide range of possible backgrounds and unusual stories. If you take the noble background, that doesn't mean you hold noble rank yourself--you could be a trusted bodyguard who's still treated as a member of the household. Perhaps a noble has made you their heir; such a thing would be unprecedented, but it would be an interesting story! With the folk hero background, you could have served as the protector of a particular village, with the story of your brave deeds spreading far and wide.

As a civilian warforged, does your class reflect your original purpose, or have you risen beyond that? For example, you could take the sage background to reflect that you were designed to be a tutor or a researcher. You weren't built to be a wizard--but over the course of your career, you began to master the arcane, far exceeding the expectations of your creators.

Warforged who served on the battlefield are forced to find a new life, because there is no war. As you weren't made for war, did the end of the war have a dramatic impact on you? The Treaty of Thronehold released you from any form of indenture, but do you still feel an attachment to your family or village? Did you ever have a sense of loyalty to a nation, or has your worldview always been shaped by the people you worked with?

#### Specialized or Unique

Battlefield warforged were largely mass produced. But there were many small runs of experimental warforged using specialized designs or experimental techniques. Perhaps your warforged rogue was part of a secret unit of assassins that were never deployed; how many others were in the unit, and what's become of them? As a warforged entertainer, were you built to be a superstar--and if so, how does House Phiarlan feel about that? As a druid, have you found a bond to the natural world within, or did an eccentric artificer design you with the potential to change shape and bond with natural creatures?

In developing an exotic warforged, talk with your DM to develop details about your creator and your purpose. Are you one of a kind or part of a small run? Do you know who built you and why, or is your true purpose a mystery even to you?

### Mind and Body

Cannith artificers designed your body and made you for a purpose. When the creation forge imbued you with life, there were things you *knew*. If you were built to be a warrior, you knew how to wield a sword and pike. You had an instinctive sense of squad tactics. There were things Cannith instructors had to teach you, but even there, it felt almost as if they were reminding you of things you already knew.

This is one of the mysteries of the warforged. Where does your sentience come from? Cannith gave direction, but they didn't design your mind; if they could, they'd have made you without emotion, and likely without the capacity for true independence. Many arcane scholars theorize that the creation forges don't create the warforged mind, but rather summon it. Some believe that the warforged soul is drawn from the planes, that a warforged soldier is infused with the essence of Shavarath. Others suggest that the creation forges could be recycling husks from Dolurrh... perhaps the reason you sometimes feel that you're remembering new skills is because you possessed those skills in a former life.

Regardless, your Cannith instructors taught you to focus solely on the purpose they gave you. They trained you to suppress emotions, to be a weapon or a tool. Now you are free, able to explore your full potential. What does this mean for you? You can feel a full range of emotions, but do you? Or are you mystified by anger and love? What do you actually care about? Do you feel loyalty to a particular person? To a nation? To the future of the warforged race? Some warforged revel in the ability to choose a new path; others hold fast to their original purpose, and just want a reason to put those skills to work.

#### Evolution

Warforged aren't machines; they're living, magical beings, and can evolve both physically and mentally. Just as you can learn new skills, your body can transform over time. This is one way to reflect class benefits; can you think of a way that your body could physically change to account for a new ability? If you gain the Defense Fighting Style, that might reflect your natural armor becoming thicker. If you're a warforged sorcerer, the ability to cast new spells could be reflected by arcane sigils appearing on your body, or by growing crystals that project light or energy. Never forget that you're the product of magic as well as science. You may be made of metal and leather, but you're also alive.

#### Integrated Protection

As a warforged, your armor is a part of you. Your skin is metal or leather, physically bonded to the rootlike tendrils that serve as your muscles. While it is possible for you to change your armor, very few warforged actually ever do this. The process is similar to a human peeling off their skin; while it's not dangerous for the warforged, it's a disturbing and uncomfortable experience. As an adventuring warforged, it's an important ability to have, as it allows you to improve your defense and to make use of magical armor. But be aware of the weight of what you're doing when you exchange your armor.

Once you have integrated a suit of armor, it cannot be removed against your will. However, you are still considered to be wearing armor for purposes of the Defense Fighting Style or other feats and benefits that relate to armor. Likewise, integrated armor can be targeted by magical effects. The Juggernaut Plating feat presented in chapter 6 enhances your integrated armor and protects it from hostile magic.

#### Integrated Tools

Just as a warforged can bond to armor or weapons, it's possible to attach a tool to its body. There are two ways to do this. The first is to acquire an *integrated tool*. As presented in chapter 7, this is a common magic item that requires attunement; through attuning the tool, you bond it to your body. An alternative is to take the Envoy Specialist feat found in chapter 6. This gives you the benefit of an attached tool without requiring attunement.

Unlike an *armblade*, an *integrated tool* represents more than just having a hammer attached to your hand. Most tools don't represent one single object, but rather, a range of smaller items. How does this manifest with you? If you have a set of integrated thieves' tools, do you use your fingers as lockpicks? Or do you draw the various tools you need out of compartments in your forearm? If you have an integrated instrument, is it built into your arm or your torso? Whatever you decide, remember that you have to have a hand free in order to make use of an integrated tool. You can say that your bagpipes are built into your chest, but you still need a free hand to play them.

An *integrated tool* can be an interesting part of a character concept that reflects the purpose a warforged was built for. A warforged outlander could have a set of cartographer's tools built into her body; she was designed to explore, using her integrated tools and innate sense of direction to constantly update her maps. A warforged entertainer with an integrated flute is a compelling image. In both cases, it's not that the warforged acquires the tool, but rather, it was part of their original design. If you have an interesting origin story, you can see if your DM will allow you to take a tool you possess at character generation as an *integrated tool*. If not, integrated tools are common magic items and can be easily acquired over the course of your adventures.

### Warforged Concepts

When creating a warforged character, a simple place to start is to ask: What did you do during the war? How have you changed since it ended? Did you choose the path you're on, or were you designed for it? Chapter 6 includes two new subclasses that a warforged could explore. The Living Weapon monk could be a warforged whose abilities reflect physical evolution combined with martial discipline. The Circle of the Forged is a druid path that lets you explore your connection to the natural world while remaining a creature of wood and stone. Here are a few other unusual concepts.

#### The Divine Tool

You were made by human hands. There are many who believe that you have no soul, that you're just a tool. What would draw you to a religion and imbue you with the faith required to channel divine magic? If you're creating a warforged paladin or cleric, here are a few ideas to consider:

- Onatar is the Sovereign of the Forge, the patron of the smith and artificer. As a Forge cleric, you might believe that the warforged weren't designed by a mortal mind; rather, Aaren d'Cannith was guided by divine inspiration to bring Onatar's children into the world. Do you want to bring humans and warforged together, promoting a peaceful coexistence? Or do you believe that the warforged have their own divine purpose that has yet to be fulfilled?
- An artificer built fifteen warforged, each to serve as an avatar for one of the Sovereigns and Six. Did they succeed? You wield divine magic; is there the seed of a Sovereign within you, waiting to grow as you gain levels? Which Sovereign do you represent? And if the experiment appears to have worked, what became of your fourteen siblings?
- You have the body of a warforged but the mind of a human. You were a devoted follower of the Blood of Vol. After death, you awoke in a warforged body. You don't know how this happened. Was it an accident? The work of a necromancer? Or are all warforged vessels for dormant ghosts? Regardless, you intend to use this second life to fight for the living.
- Any noble soul can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to protect the innocent. Were you inspired by a paladin who fought by your side, and you took up their sword when they fell in battle? Or perhaps you were *designed* to channel the power of the Flame--a prototype commissioned by one of the Cardinals of Thrane. Are you a miracle, a celebrated champion of the church with the acolyte background? Or has Cardinal Krozen branded you an abomination?

#### The Docent Warlock

A *docent* is a sentient magic item, a sphere that attaches to the chest of a warforged and offers guidance. Ancient *docents* have been found in Xen'drik, artifacts of unknown age and origin. You found such a *docent* and it's attached to your body, altering your physiology and gifting you with supernatural powers. Mechanically you're a warlock, but you wear your patron on your chest. The patron you choose reveals something about the nature of the *docent*. If you take the Fiend as your patron, it suggests that a dark power could be bound in the *docent*. If you take the Celestial as your patron, perhaps the *docent* holds a spirit of light. The *docent* is the source of your powers, but you don't know if you can trust it; discovering the true nature of the *docent* will be part of your unfolding story. Is it a magic item created by a forgotten society? Or is an immortal spirit bound in the docent... and if so, what does it want?

While the story idea is that you found a *docent*, your patron doesn't use an attunement slot and you can't actually remove it; it's become a part of you. However, if you do somehow remove it, you won't lose the powers you already possess. Should this happen, perhaps you'll have to find a new patron, or perhaps you'll find that the power was a part of you all along.

#### The Forgotten Assassin

You awoke in the bottom of a lake. You have no memory of how you got there or anything of your life before that moment. As warforged don't need to breathe, you made your way back to shore. You're a warforged rogue, quick and deadly. But you have flashes of your past, glimpses of memory in which you're an assassin possessing far greater skills than you have today. As you gain levels, you are actually regaining these skills you once possessed. As you do so, perhaps you'll also recover your memory. Who did you work for? Who did you kill? How and why was your memory wiped? And most of all, are you sure you want to know the answer?

# Chapter 3: Faiths of Eberron

![Artist: Katerina Poliakova](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/48%20katerina%20poliakova.jpg)

>>There's no evil in the heart of a newborn child. But demons prey on our base emotions, and from the moment we're born, the fiends start calling us down their dark paths. None of us are perfect, and there will be times when even the best are lured into darkness. But remember: the child who's gone astray isn't the enemy--they're the victim. You carry the Flame. Don't burn the misguided; instead, banish the shadows and lead them back into the light.
>>
>>--Tira Miron, *To the Templars*
>>

When humans first set foot on Khorvaire, they thanked Kol Korran for seeing them safely across the water. King Galifar I believed that it was Dol Arrah who guided him to victory and looked to Aureon to inspire his rule. But the humans didn't invent the Sovereign Host. Explorers in Xen'drik have uncovered a vast temple dedicated to Ouralon Lawbringer--a clear parallel to the Sovereign of Law and Lore, worshiped by the giants tens of thousands of years before human civilization existed.

For many hundreds of years, the Sovereign Host stood as the bedrock faith of Galifar and the Five Nations. But over centuries, cracks began to form. In Thrane, a young paladin delivered the nation from fiendish domination, crediting her victory to an ancient force of light. The people she saved were quick to embrace the faith of the Silver Flame, and it gradually spread across Galifar. Meanwhile, in the far northeast, a small but devoted following held to the teachings of the Blood of Vol.

Some scholars say that the growing power of industry and arcane science weakened faith. Why should a blacksmith make an offering to Onatar when he could use his copper to take Cannith courses and learn *magecraft*? Others say that the Last War is to blame. Whatever the cause, there are certainly many in Khorvaire who have no deep devotion to any religion. None would deny that divine power exists, but in a world with sorcerers and dragonmarks, the ability to perform magic is no assurance of the existence of gods. But many faithful see no conflict between the wonders of the modern age and their devotions. Even House Cannith has always claimed to prosper through the blessing of Onatar, and there have always been those within the house who have asked the Traveler for dangerous inspiration. While the Mourning caused some people to question their beliefs, for others, their faith was the source of stability and comfort in a bleak world: *Whatever horrors we face, surely there is a reason for our suffering... a divine purpose we can't yet understand.*

This chapter examines the role of divine power in daily life and explores the differences between arcane and divine magic. It examines the three major religions of Khorvaire and delves into the occult mysteries of the cults of the Dragon Below. It concludes with revelations about the aasimar and their place in the world of Eberron.

## The Role of the Divine

While scholars debate if the Sovereigns truly exist, the presence of divine forces can be felt in everyday life. This is more pronounced in specific places--Thrane, Aerenal, a Seeker community in Karrnath--but even on the cynical streets of Breland, you can consult an oracle of Aureon or get help from an exorcist of the Silver Flame. Similarly, people may criticize the actions of the Church of the Silver Flame, but no one doubts that the Flame itself exists, and everyone knows that its champions wield mystic power. Player characters are remarkable, and paladins are rare, but it's common knowledge that paladins exist. When a paladin heals a wounded soldier by laying on hands, it's impressive, but not unprecedented. How is divine power encountered in the world, and how does it differ from the magic of wizards and artificers?

### What is Divine Magic?

A cleric, a bard, and an artificer can all cast cure wounds. Working strictly by the rules, the only difference between the three characters is the spellcasting ability associated with each, so arcane and divine magic aren't concrete mechanical concepts. Rather, it is part of the story itself, with the artificer and cleric each doing something fundamentally different; the artificer creates a quick healing salve, while the cleric lays their hands on the victim and calls for a miracle. This section explores the difference between arcane and divine magic, suggesting flavor that you can employ in describing the actions of spellcasters.

> ##### Spoiler Alert
>
>While much of this chapter is applicable to both players and DMs, some information lies ahead that isn't common knowledge to most player characters. Even characters with proficiency in Religion don't automatically know the deep lore of their faith; for example, most clerics devoted to the Blood of Vol don't know how Erandis Vol is connected to it. As a player, recognize that your character is unlikely to know all the things you're about to read, and work with your DM to determine how much they know about their religion and its secrets.

>It's also important to note that the faiths of Eberron have been presented in different ways over the course of different books and editions of the game. As a DM, it's up to you to decide what's true in your campaign. And as a player, keep in mind that your DM may not take this book as gospel! This chapter is meant as a source of inspiration, not as absolute truth.

#### Arcane Magic

Arcane magic is a form of science. There are predictable rules that shape reality, and with proper study and force of will, anyone could potentially perform arcane magic. This is what makes arcane magic the foundation of civilization in the Five Nations: it can be taught, and once learned, it is entirely reliable. Arcane magic involves channeling ambient magical energy--the powers of the planes, the emanations of the Ring of Siberys--and focusing it to alter reality. The components of a spell--like verbal incantations, somatic gestures, and focus items--help this process, but the most important element of spellcasting is mental focus. Though a fighter could perfectly duplicate the words and gestures of a wizard, nothing would happen. You must cast the spell in your mind, harnessing and shaping mystical energy, and this is dangerous and exhausting; this is why most spellcasters are limited in how many spells they can cast each day.

All arcane magic consists of reliable skills you can master, but there are different forms of arcane magic. While a wizard and sorcerer can both cast fireball, there's a difference, tied to the ability associated with spellcasting.

***Intelligence.*** Spellcasting using Intelligence is grounded in knowledge and logic. For these characters, casting a spell is like solving an equation--harnessing and carefully channeling the precise quantity of mystical energy required to produce the effect you're looking for. A wizard may use words of power and mystic gestures to generate power, while an artificer instead relies on tools. But either way, you fundamentally know what you're doing, which is why both artificers and wizards can prepare new spells each day. Arcane magic is a science, and you're a scientist.

***Charisma.*** Spellcasting using Charisma is tied to instinct and force of personality. For these characters, casting a spell is like knowing a few amazing family recipes even though you have no concept of the fundamental principles of baking. Your spellcasting talents may come from an arcane bloodline, a mystic patron, or a magical song. Regardless, you still have to perform similar actions to a wizard; to cast a *fireball*, you still need somatic gestures and verbal incantations along with a ball of guano or an arcane focus. But you don't have to understand what you're doing the way a wizard does; you just know that if you follow the recipe, you'll get a perfect result.

In general, wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, artificers, bards, wandslingers, and magewrights use arcane magic. This still leaves room for individual flavor, and the techniques of an Aereni wizard may look quite different from those of an Aundairian wandslinger. But the same basic science underlies them both, and the principles of verbal and somatic components are familiar, even if the precise gestures or words are different. You can decide your character breaks this tradition, but this doesn't change any mechanical rules. You might say that your bard uses divine magic to cast spells--singing prayers to the Sovereigns, for example. However, this won't change your spellcasting ability or allow you to use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, unless you make arrangements with your DM.

#### Divine Magic

There's no logic to divine magic, no pure science that can explain exactly how it works. An acolyte might spend years meditating and praying, performing virtuous deeds, and tending their flock, and still never gain the power to cast a spell; meanwhile, a smith who can't even read might feel Onatar's guiding hands and cast *magecraft*. Divine magic requires two things: absolute faith and a connection to a divine power source.

Faith is about conviction. It can't be something you approach rationally. You need to know in your heart that the magical effect you seek to produce with your spell should and will happen. Whether you're smiting an enemy or healing an ally, you know that the enemy will fall and that you will save your friend. This doesn't mean that you have to be a zealot with no doubts whatsoever; you can question your overall course of action. But you can't think about your doubts in the moment of casting the spell; in that instant, you must have pure and absolute certainty that the spell will come to pass.

But faith alone isn't enough; you also need a connection to a source of divine power. In Eberron, no one can prove whether the Sovereigns or other deities exist--if Onatar actually guides all artisans or if Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah truly watch over every battlefield. But whether or not Dol Arrah exists, when her paladin smites a foe, they draw that power from something. The paladin believes it to be Dol Arrah granting her favor, and maybe it is. Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power. But why does one templar become a paladin over another of equal faith? Why does an illiterate farmer gain the gift of divine magic when a religious scholar who's spent decades studying texts doesn't? People of faith usually respond that it's because the farmer was chosen by Arawai, or because one templar was more open than the other to the Voice of the Flame. Maybe that's true, or maybe it's all just luck.

As a paladin or cleric, you are tied to a source of divine power. Have you been chosen for a grand purpose? Did you earn this gift through piety or virtue? No one can prove the answer one way or the other. All that matters is that you have your faith, and that when you call for divine power, something answers.

***Manifestations of Divine Magic.*** To the outside observer, divine magic is very different in flavor from arcane magic. A wizard traces glowing sigils and speaks words in a language older than humanity; a priest simply points dramatically at their enemy and calls on the Silver Flame to strike them down. Whether a spell is fueled by arcane or divine power, however, it still requires verbal and somatic components. Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: "Dol Arrah smite my foe!" or "Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!" Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component. The caster doesn't just ask for something; they reach out and *take* the power from the divine source, and if they draw too heavily on this connection, it'll be exhausted until they can rest.

***The Value of Uncertainty.*** Mechanically, there's no difference between arcane magic and divine magic. But Eberron's divine magic is inherently more mysterious--it's not a science and shouldn't be entirely consistent or reliable. If you and your DM both agree to it, the DM could add some uncertainty to your divine magic. Consider a few ways this could manifest:

- A spell could have a more powerful effect than you expected, as if cast with a spell slot of a higher level.
- The target of a spell could gain advantage or disadvantage on a saving throw against it.
- A target could be unexpectedly included or excluded from a spell effect.

This uncertainty should never become commonplace. It's the sort of thing that might happen once or twice during an adventure, if at all, and it should never be something you demand. It's a way to add that sense that divine magic isn't logical--not to create a concrete advantage or disadvantage for divine casters.

You should generally have a sense of why the uncertainty is happening. If you doubt the righteousness of your cause, it would make sense for you to have disadvantage on your attack roll; conversely, if you're a Silver Flame priest facing one of the Lords of Dust and you've just made an impassioned speech condemning them in the name of the Flame, you might expect a surge in power. But divine magic should never be entirely logical. If you cast *flame strike* and one of the targets is entirely untouched, is it because your faith faltered, or could it be a sign that you are supposed to spare this person's life?

***Visions and Portents.*** As a divine caster, you are in touch with a divine power source. DMs can add a sense of mystery to divine magic by granting you divine visions. This might be clear and direct: during a long rest, you have a vision of a dark cloud over a nearby town. You know that evil forces are gathering there and that you have been charged to defend the townsfolk. This can be an easy way to set an adventure in motion. But it can also be more cryptic and intriguing: as your paladin enters the village, you see a burning crown floating above the head of a crippled beggar. The vision lasts an instant and is gone, with no further guidance. Is it a sign that the beggar is the rightful ruler and you should restore him to power? Is it a warning that he's an agent of Rak Tulkhesh? There is no clear answer; it's up to you to interpret it. The divine power is telling you something, but can your mortal mind make sense of it? As with unreliable magic, visions should be rare and remarkable. Such a vision is a reminder that you are in touch with a higher power, but you should never take this gift for granted or come to expect it.

#### Other Forms of Magic

Divine magic and arcane magic are the two most common forms of spellcasting, but they're far from the only paths. Primal magic draws on the ambient power of the natural world, and is commonly used by druids and rangers. The verbal components of a primal spell might include a bird call or invocation of an animal spirit; somatic components might mimic the motion of a beast or spreading roots. Psionic magic uses the focused power of the mind, and chapter 2 includes suggestions for adding psionic flavor to kalashtar characters. A warlock might say that they are directly channeling their patron, acting simply as a vessel for that power.

### Divine Magic in Everyday Life

Faith is a part of everyday life in the Five Nations. The people of Galifar were devoted to the Sovereign Host, and this echoes through its institutions--marriages are sanctified by Boldrei and judges swear oaths to Aureon. The Sovereign Aureon is the patron of wizards and magewrights, and Cannith artificers look to Onatar and the Traveler for inspiration. Many dragonmarked heirs assert that their marks are divine gifts.

So faith remains widespread, and there is no inherent clash between arcane and divine magic, but most commercial magical services are provided by arcane magewrights, not divine adepts. Priests can often cast *thaumaturgy* or *ceremony*, but rarely wield other forms of magic. The job of the priest is to provide spiritual guidance to their community; if you're looking to fix your injured leg, you go to a Jorasco healing house, not to a temple.

As a result, people are well aware of divine magic, but it's not taken for granted in the same way arcane magic is. The people of Eberron understand that divine magic isn't necessarily reliable, as discussed in the "Gifts in Time of Need" sidebar. A paladin player character will never lose their class abilities, but an NPC templar might gain divine power only when fighting supernatural evil and be unable to produce those effects at other times.

People with the abilities of clerics and paladins are usually found serving as champions of their faiths. They are exorcists, templar commanders, inquisitors, and missionaries venturing into dangerous lands. You wouldn't just go into a temple of Boldrei and demand to be healed. Clerics and paladins are remarkable, and people will assume that you were given your powers for a special purpose. NPC clerics of Boldrei might be found operating charitable clinics or fighting outbreaks of plague.

> ##### Gifts in Time of Need
>

>>Long ago, a simple smith received Onatar's blessing, and from then on, found he could use divine magic to cast magecraft. When a gang of bandits threatened his village, the old man struck down the bandit leader, then smote those who didn't flee. He exclaimed that Dol Arrah and Boldrei empowered him to protect his people. But when the bandits fled, this strength left him and he died.
>>

>This is a typical folktale in the Five Nations. You can't choose to become a divine spellcaster; the power is given to you. While some say this proves the existence of divine intervention, others assert it's simply that deep devotion allows anyone to channel divine power under the right circumstances. In some cases, divine power can be temporarily granted by an immortal entity, as the paladin Tira Miron was strengthened in her battle against Bel Shalor by a couatl guardian.
>
>Player characters rarely have power stripped away; their core abilities should be reliable unless the player and DM agree to add uncertainty to their abilities. But NPCs could receive temporary divine gifts; the old smith described above could be a vital ally in a battle, but at the end of the adventure, his powers leave him. In the case of a player character, any character with faith could temporarily receive a boon (as presented in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) tied to a particular quest or purpose. That purpose might be made clear--gifted by a spiritual guide like Tira's couatl, or revealed in a divine vision--or it could be a mystery. Such a gift is temporary, and will be lost when it has served its purpose. This sort of gift should be especially rare and remarkable; Tira and the couatl is a legendary event, not something taken for granted. But it is something that can happen if it fits an adventure.
>

While it's rare to find people selling divine magic as a service, it's not unheard of. Breland is infamous for corruption, and an NPC cleric could demand gold for mystical assistance. Oracles of Aureon typically demand "donations" for their insights. And in places where faith is especially strong or widespread, adepts can be found providing services commonly performed by magewrights. In a Seeker community in Karrnath, you may find skeletons animated by the local priest tilling a field. A devout blacksmith might cast *magecraft* by calling on Onatar instead of learning it from Cannith--but unlike with arcane magic, this devout blacksmith can't teach the spell to an apprentice. Divine spellcasting is a gift, not a job; an apprentice might earn that gift with their own devotion, but it's never a sure thing.

Within the Five Nations, Thrane is the greatest example of divine magic being worked into everyday life. Even there, Jorasco still provides healing and people rely on Sivis speaking stones to communicate. But in Flamekeep the streets are lit with silvery *everbright lanterns* created by adepts instead of artificers, and many other common services are provided by divine faith instead of arcane science. Beyond the Five Nations, the cultures of Aerenal and the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes use divine magic nearly as commonly as arcane services.

### Questioning Faith

Divine magic is real. For a player character, it's reliable, and under fifth edition rules, clerics and paladins don't risk losing their powers if their actions aren't perfectly aligned with their faith. As discussed in the "What is Divine Magic" section above, there are many ways to reflect the importance of faith and what makes playing a divine spellcaster feel distinctly different than playing a wizard.

But what happens when that faith falters? A DM and player could work together to reflect the evolution or even loss of faith by an equally dramatic mechanical change to a character. Consider a paladin who discovers or does something that deeply undermines their faith. If the character simply loses their class features, no one will have fun. But you could redesign the character as a fighter of the same level, reflecting the idea that their divine abilities are gone, but they're still a tough, hardbitten warrior. Or in reverse, you could start a campaign playing a fighter as a former paladin who lost your way; if you find redemption or new faith over the course of the campaign, you could eventually redesign the character to be a full paladin.

Similarly, a character's beliefs might evolve rather than be lost entirely. Tira Miron began as a paladin of Dol Arrah but later embraced the Silver Flame. It's equally possible for a cleric of the Sovereign Host to have a journey that leads them to embrace the Blood of Vol; this sort of character evolution can be a remarkable story, and be reflected mechanically by the DM and player working together to swap their class archetype.

These mechanical changes might require some suspension of disbelief, as the paladin who becomes a fighter might suddenly be a significantly better fighter, and the cleric who swaps domains might lose proficiencies and have to throw away their armor. This is an imperfect process, and it's up to both player and DM to find ways to push past this and explain them within the story: *"My armor was a prison. Now that I've embraced the light, I can't bear to carry the weight of war on my shoulders."* It's important to maintain game balance, even if it means overlooking a few blips in the story. But changing beliefs can be a good reason for a dramatic mechanical shift within a character. Ultimately, your beliefs--or lack thereof--don't have to be limited by a class choice you made at 1st level. Whether it's ultimately strengthened or abandoned, questioning and exploring faith can be an interesting path for any character.

## The Silver Flame: Defending the Innocent

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/52%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

Eberron is just one bad day away from collapsing into a demonic apocalypse. The fiendish overlords struggle against their bonds, and shapeshifting rakshasa are manipulating humanity and working to release their masters. If you live in Khorvaire, you know as absolute fact that the dead can rise to prey on the living. You know that horrific aberrations could burst out of the underworld at any time and that the bite of a werewolf is all it would take to turn you into a murderous monster. The more you know, the worse it gets--even your dreams could be orchestrated by the Dreaming Dark. These things aren't questions of faith; these are simple facts. The overlords embody our worst fears. They thrive on hatred, cruelty, and chaos. Even when they're bound, they can use their influence to drive people toward darkness. And if they break their bonds, the world as you know it will be destroyed.

These realities--and the need to protect the world from them--form the vital foundation of the Church of the Silver Flame. This is a world where deadly supernatural evil is a concrete fact of existence, and the church itself was founded when a noble paladin gave her life to pull her nation back from the abyss. Some might mistakenly see the church merely as a militant hierarchical religious organization and assume that it must be a force of oppression. But while the Church of the Silver Flame is a religion, it's equally a volunteer militia whose members are prepared to risk their lives to protect every innocent from the real and deadly threats lurking in the shadows. At the end of the day, the templar isn't there to tell you how you should live your life; they're there to make sure you can live your life, to protect you from the monsters and fiends that could appear at any moment.

### Foundations of the Faith

The Silver Flame was forged in the Age of Demons, and heroes of many cultures have wielded its power over the ages. The following principles form the common foundation of the Flame, regardless of whether you're a Ghaash'kala orc or a templar of Thrane--though extremist sects pick and choose which tenets to follow or discard. When dealing with followers of the Silver Flame, keep these in mind.

#### A Power, Not A God

The Silver Flame is a force created during the Age of Demons to bind the overlords. It has a concrete purpose: it is the cage that keeps apocalyptic evil at bay. The Sovereigns and Six are deities, believed to influence every facet of daily life. The Silver Flame is different. It's not seen as an anthropomorphic entity; rather, followers recognize it as a pure force of celestial energy. It doesn't influence the world on its own, and can only empower champions who will use that gift to protect the innocent. The Flame itself doesn't speak to people; instead, it is the Voice of the Flame that guides the faithful. Ultimately, the Silver Flame is a resource; if you seek to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, you may be able to draw on the power of the Flame to aid you in your fight.

#### Coexistence

The Silver Flame won't grant you a good harvest as Arawai will, nor will it send storms like the Devourer. The Silver Flame isn't a god, but a resource to serve a specific purpose, and there is no inherent conflict between the beliefs of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host. The Church of the Silver Flame is a practical, pragmatic faith founded on active public service. It takes the approach that the world will manage itself--that there will be a harvest or a storm whether or not you acknowledge Arawai or the Devourer--and that the most important thing is to protect people from the darkness that could destroy them. The church doesn't inherently challenge the worship of the Sovereigns, and the two faiths have coexisted peacefully throughout history. Paladins of Dol Arrah often coordinate with templars of the Silver Flame to deal with threats, and Vassals of the Sovereign Host are usually happy to accept the assistance of templars when danger strikes.

#### Defense of All

The Silver Flame protects the entire world from the evil of the overlords, and likewise, those who channel its power should protect all innocents from supernatural threats. While extremist sects may stray from this path, the core beliefs of the Church of the Silver Flame don't elevate any nation or species above another. Templars of the Silver Flame should protect everyone from evil. Friars should guide and care for all who are in need.

This principle was clearly evident during the Last War. Even when the Church took power in Thrane, most priests and templars in other nations continued to serve their people. Regardless of the position of the cardinals and the Keeper, the mission of the Flame is to defend the innocent, not to rule the world. Brelish and Cyran templars would quickly unite with Thranes if a supernatural threat arose in the midst of a conflict; if demons from Shavarath appeared on a battlefield, all templars would unite against them. But in the absence of supernatural evil, there's nothing preventing a templar from serving their nation or protecting their family. While the templars of Thrane are also the army of Thrane, they still recognize the difference between their sacred duty and their service to their nation.

#### Eternal Evil

The Silver Flame was kindled to bind the fiendish overlords, immortal spirits that cannot be destroyed. The overlords are the embodiments of hatred, fear, greed, cruelty--and, like the overlords themselves, these things can never be permanently destroyed, only held at bay. The message of the Silver Flame isn't that evil can ever be permanently eradicated. It is that we must be ever vigilant and prepared to deal with evil when it arises. Even in the most peaceful moments, a new terror could emerge from Khyber, or a gate could spill shadows out of Mabar. And even in a town of virtuous people, someone could be corrupted by greed or anger. The templar stands ever ready to fight the physical threat, while the minister seeks to keep their people on the virtuous path.

#### Afterlife and the Voices of the Flame

The basic doctrine of the Silver Flame doesn't promise punishment or paradise after death. But its faithful commonly believe that the souls of those who live virtuous lives pass through Dolurrh unharmed, merging with the Silver Flame itself. By strengthening the Flame, these souls continue to protect the innocent of generations to come. Merging with the Flame is generally depicted as a transcendent union with those who have gone before, a state beyond mortal understanding--seen both as a reward and a duty.

Typically, souls that merge with the Flame don't return to the mortal world. However, it is possible for a spirit within the Flame to maintain its identity, guiding or advising the faithful from beyond. The Church of the Silver Flame calls out Tira Miron as the Voice of the Flame, who stands between eternity and mortality and guides the faithful toward the light. However, the Ghaash'kala and the serpent cults existed long before the sacrifice of Tira Miron, and they have their own Voices of the Flame--heroes who guide the faithful of these cultures.

### The Hierarchy of Evil

The Silver Flame empowers mortals to fight against evil. But not all evils are equal, and different threats call for different approaches. The Church of the Silver Flame defines the hierarchy of evil as follows:

- **Entities of alien evil.** These are the children of Khyber, encompassing all manner of fiends and aberrations. These beings are fundamentally unnatural and innately malevolent; even their presence is seen as harmful to the world.
- **Entities of unnatural evil.** These are beings once native to Eberron that have been corrupted by alien forces. Undead and lycanthropes are the most obvious examples of this category--innocent people transformed into monsters. Like the followers of the Undying Court, the Church of the Silver Flame maintains that undead are inherently unnatural and harm the living simply through their existence.
- **Entities of innate evil.** This is the most contentious category on the list, and it is the idea of *monsters*--that there are creatures native to Eberron who are evil by nature. In the past, the church has placed medusas, harpies, trolls, and similar creatures into this category, asserting that through no fault of their own, these creatures are vessels for supernatural evil and pose a threat to the innocent.
- **Those who choose evil.** This encompasses all humanoids who are born innocent but choose to follow an evil path. Because such beings aren't evil by nature, the goal of the faithful should always be to lead them back to the light.
- **The evil within.** Every follower of the Flame must recognize their own capacity for evil action; only through awareness can they guard against it. The Shadow in the Flame is always whispering, and it is arrogant and foolish to ignore that threat.

Entities of alien and unnatural evil must be fought with steel and spell. This is the purpose of the Silver Flame: to protect the innocent against these threats. When such forces arise, followers of the Silver Flame are expected to set aside any differences until the evil is defeated; this was seen in the Last War, where templars might serve different nations but would unite to deal with a supernatural threat. If it's possible to eradicate a threat without violence--such as curing a lycanthrope rather than killing it--that's acceptable, even laudable. But protection of the innocent should always be the primary concern, which is why the Silver Crusade focused on the eradication of the lycanthropes; the templars rarely had the resources to capture and cure lycanthropes.

> ##### Celestials and the Silver Flame
>
>The Silver Flame is tied to Eberron. If you worship the Flame and cast a spell that normally contacts or summons an extraplanar ally, you touch the power of the Flame itself. This could be a couatl, or you could speak to the Voice of the Silver Flame--the spirit of Tira Miron, though now that she is bound to the Silver Flame, she is far more than just a ghost. *Conjure celestial* will usually summon a couatl, its essence drawn from the Silver Flame and given temporary existence until its task is done. *Planar ally* can produce more powerful celestials, but these aren't called from another plane; while they may use the statistics of angels, they are formed from the pure light of the Flame itself and return to the Flame when their work is done.
>

With those who choose evil and those who fall prey to the evil within, the Church of the Silver Flame urges compassion over brutality. Templars take arms against unnatural evil, but it is the purpose of friars and ministers to guide mortals to the light. Innocents must always be protected from those who would harm them, but anyone who chooses evil could be convinced to choose good, and true followers of the Flame are encouraged to act with empathy and compassion for all natural creatures.

In the past, the church assumed that trolls, harpies, worgs, and similar creatures were innately evil, so templars eliminated these threats wherever they were encountered. With the rise of Droaam and House Tharashk's introduction of monstrous mercenaries, Khorvaire is learning that these creatures aren't any more inherently evil than humans or dwarves. Ultimately, it is up to the Keeper of the Flame to make rulings on these matters--much like a past Keeper's ruling that the deathless of Aerenal are not creatures of unnatural evil. In 992 YK, Keeper Lavira Tagor ruled that the church needed to reevaluate the classification of innate evil, and that templars should judge the actions of creatures in question and seek guidance from the Voice of the Flame. Since then, the Council of Cardinals has been debating the status of Droaam, but Keeper Daran has yet to make a final ruling on the matter.

The Ghaash'kala, serpent cults, and other paths have their own traditions, each with the same core principle--the Silver Flame is a tool that allows the virtuous to fight fiends and unnatural horrors. Though those paths may share similar beliefs, this particular hierarchy of evil is specifically defined by the Keeper and the doctrine of the Church of Thrane.

### Heresy

The Church of the Silver Flame represents just one path of the faith. It was built on the teachings of Tira Miron, but less than a year elapsed between her vision--leading her to embrace the Flame and rally an army--and her final sacrifice to defeat Bel Shalor. Thus, it wasn't her own words that established most of the church's traditions and doctrines, but the words of those who fought alongside her during that year. These were refined over time by priests who'd never met her--despite the passage of time, it's believed these priests were guided by the Voice in the Flame.

The Keeper of the Flame is tied specifically to the official Church of the Silver Flame. The Keeper's power is based in Flamekeep, and the fountain of fire they keep marks the spot where Tira Miron gave her life to restore the bonds of the overlord Bel Shalor. Some people mistakenly assume that this fountain of fire *is* the Silver Flame. While it's a focal point where the Silver Flame's power bleeds into the world and a conduit for those who seek the guidance of the Voice of the Flame, the Silver Flame itself is far more than a spark in one cathedral--its power stretches across Eberron, binding overlords on every continent. The Church of the Silver Flame celebrates the Keeper of the Flame as being both the vessel of the Voice and the channel for the power of the Flame. However, the faithful of other cultures--such as the Ghaash'kala of the Demon Wastes--see the Keeper as a powerful priest and nothing more.

The Church of the Silver Flame is largely willing to overlook the divergent beliefs of groups like the Ghaash'kala. In the church's eyes, these northern orcs are a curiosity and their unusual beliefs don't threaten the faithful of the Five Nations. Likewise, the Council of Cardinals has taken no action to suppress the extreme beliefs of the Pure Flame, even going so far as appointing the puritan Archbishop Dariznu as governor of Thaliost. In part, this is because the Pure Flame came into its own over the course of the Last War, and the cardinals of Thrane had little ability to enforce their will over the faithful of Aundair. Dariznu's appointment was an effort to ensure that the followers of the Pure Flame would accept the authority of Flamekeep. Despite the church thus far taking no action against the Pure Flame, Keeper Daran is deeply troubled by this sect and is considering the best way to address the problem.

There have been times when heretical beliefs divided the church, the most infamous known as the Time of Two Keepers. In 497 YK, a peasant woman calling herself Melysse Miron challenged Keeper Kyra Danth for control of Flamekeep and the Church of the Silver Flame. Melysse claimed that Tira Miron had revealed she was Tira's direct descendant and the rightful Keeper. She challenged many church doctrines and claimed it had strayed from its path. And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame--it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn't killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.

More recently, the church was divided in 914 YK when Keeper Serrain was invested with temporal authority over the nation of Thrane. While many celebrated the idea of a kingdom founded on the noble principles of the church, there are many--even some in Thrane itself--who believe that investing cardinals and Keeper with political power distracts the church from its proper mission and serves as an invitation to corruption. This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn't rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain. In the wake of this division, Stormreach was formally severed from Flamekeep; it receives no support and Flamekeep doesn't acknowledge its priests within the church hierarchy. As such, Stormreach has become a haven for those who believe in the principles of the Flame but question its doctrine.

It's up to the DM to decide if the rifts over the theocracy and the Pure Flame could widen or whether the faithful will remain united. There is always room for new revelations or beliefs to create a new path for the faithful to follow.

> ##### Miron's Tears
>
>Most believe Miron's Tears to be an urban legend--a secret order of spies and assassins deep within the Church of the Silver Flame, hidden even from the Keeper and the Cardinals. According to the stories, Tira Miron foresaw the danger of the Shadow in the Flame. On the eve of her battle with Bel Shalor, Tira charged her trusted companion Samyr Kes to monitor the Church that was to come for signs of fiendish corruption--to save those who could be saved, and eliminate those who could not. Those who believe these tales say that it was agents of Miron's Tears who recognized the threat of Melysse Miron and exposed her as an agent of Bel Shalor.
>
>It's up to the DM to decide if this order exists or if it died out long ago. If he still lives, Samyr Kes--an elf whose long life has been extended by the Flame--could be disgusted by the corruption of the modern church. Beyond combating fiendish corruption, Miron's Tears could target greedy priests in Breland, fight the extremism of the Pure Flame in Aundair, or even seek to bring down the Thranish theocracy, seeing it as a corrupting influence on the church. Virtuous player characters could be recruited into the order. Or chaos could ensue when an ally of the player characters--secretly a servant of the Lords of Dust--is targeted by the Tears.

### Corruption

The Church of the Silver Flame has lofty aspirations, and it's easy to find fault when it fails to live up to them. While there's always potential for corruption in the church, it's often exaggerated. Stories about corrupt priests can be more dramatic than virtuous ministers who are only there to help, but the majority of priests *do* strive to live its principles--resisting the evil within, treating others with compassion and empathy, and working together for the common good. The point isn't that the church is a fundamentally corrupt institution, but rather that no one is perfect--in their imperfections, people can be led astray by the Shadow in the Flame or simply succumb to pride or greed.

In dealing with corrupt followers of the faith, consider what kind of "corruption" it is and where it comes from. There's a considerable difference between the Brelish priest who demands gold for a blessing and the Thrane inquisitor who lets their zeal for fighting evil drive them to cruelty.

***Zealots.*** represent the most common form of corruption, especially among paladins or clerics. A zealot is devoted to the principles of the faith, but loses sight of the importance of compassion--giving in to the evil within in their quest to fight evil in the world. This includes those who engage in unnecessary cruelty, especially when dealing with those who choose evil. Zealots have no interest in gold or power, and risk their lives to defend others; they are simply able to justify ruthless and evil actions in the name of the greater good. This is the primary sin of the Pure Flame, but zealots can be found anywhere.

***Opportunists.*** seek to use their religious authority for personal gain. This typically involves charging people for services that should be granted freely, or gaining gold or influence by using church resources for unrelated purposes. In Sharn, Archierophant Ythana Morr is often accused of using templars as mercenaries and serving as a strongarm for local merchants. Usually this reflects a fundamental lack of faith, and as a result, opportunists rarely wield divine magic. If an opportunist can channel the power of the Flame, it suggests that somehow, they are able to justify these conflicting concepts--that they truly believe their actions are righteous and serve the greater good, even if those actions incidentally line the pockets of the priest. Such a character might believe that they need greater wealth or influence to help others, or that they are fighting fire with fire--teaching the wicked the error of their ways through political or economic means. Before the Last War, opportunists were usually found in Breland, but the rise of the theocracy has yielded more opportunists in Thrane as well.

***The Tarnished.*** are the worst form of corruption: priests or templars who knowingly serve the Lords of Dust or the Shadow in the Flame while posing as servants of the light. The Tarnished may mimic a devout priest--as Melysse Miron did in the Time of Two Keepers--but they are drawing this power from the Shadow in the Flame. This still requires deep faith, but the Tarnished are devoted to quite different principles. The most widespread form of this corruption is the cult of the Whispering Flame, described in the section on "The Cults of the Dragon Below." But the Tarnished can also be loners who embrace the evil within alone. In dealing with a Tarnished villain, consider what has caused them to embrace darkness over light. Have the Lords of Dust promised them something priceless? Do they believe mortals are fundamentally flawed or that the cruelty of Bel Shalor is the rightful state of humanity? Do they somehow see themselves as the heroes of the story?

### Paths of the Faith

The Silver Flame is older than humanity itself. The Church of the Silver Flame is the dominant manifestation of this faith on Khorvaire, but you can be a follower of the Silver Flame without having ties to the church. In creating a player character or NPC, consider the following options, or if you're interested in playing a Tarnished character, refer to the section on "The Cults of the Dragon Below" later in this chapter.

#### The Common Faith

Templars, friars, and ministers are all part of the formal hierarchy of the Church of the Silver Flame. But you can be a cleric without being an acolyte. You could be a ranger who trusts in the Flame to sharpen your aim even though you have no formal role within the faith. Most of the commoners of Thrane fall into this category: people devoted to the faith, but not part of its structure. What role does the Silver Flame play in daily life?

A few basic tenets guide the faithful masses. As a farmer, you may not have the strength to fight alien evils, but you can always guard against the evil within and help those around you to choose light instead of darkness. Church doctrine urges the faithful to act with empathy and compassion, seek to understand the troubles of those around you and to lighten their burdens, resist responding to anger with anger, and turn to violence only as a last resort. Not everyone can live up to these ideals, and the Last War was an inherently violent time. But the faith still urges everyone to resist the evil within, and instead to embrace the virtues of generosity and compassion.

As discussed earlier, the church also emphasizes unity against supernatural threats. The world is a dangerous place, and those who have strength should always use it to defend the innocent. Every village in Thrane maintains a militia prepared to defend the community from the unnatural. Archery is a common devotional practice among the faithful; some say the rainbow-feathered arrows represent the couatl defending the innocent, but they also reflect the practicality of remaining as far away from danger as possible.

The Church of Thrane believes in the value of hierarchy, but the church can't grant the divine powers of a cleric or paladin--these come through faith and noble intent. As such, you can play a character who draws power from the Flame without having any formal tie to the church itself. The primary question is why--if you are a paladin, why have you made the decision not to become a templar? Do you feel the hierarchy is corrupt? Or do you simply feel you're called to follow a different path?

#### The Church Hierarchy

Backgrounds are an easy way to create a character with an established place in the hierarchy of the Church of the Silver Flame. Ministers and friars would typically take the acolyte background, while the Military Rank feature of the soldier background can reflect your rank as a templar. Are you still an active agent of the church, or have you been released from your duties after serving with distinction? *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* presents the templars as an option for the religious order group patron, exploring the idea that your entire group of adventurers could be fighting evil on behalf of the church. However, you could also serve alone. Friars of the Silver Flame are charged to wander the world and combat evil through acts of compassion and charity; if you're a friar with the powers of a paladin or a cleric, that would certainly encompass protecting innocents from supernatural evil wherever you encounter it. You could be a retired templar who continues to fight evil as an adventurer, or you could be a templar given a specific mission that coincides with the goals of the adventurers. Or you could be tied to the Argentum, an order which began with the mission of finding and destroying dangerous magic items, but that has since come to serve as the espionage arm of the church.

In making a character with ties to the hierarchy, consider which branch of the church you call home and how this affects your outlook. If you were trained in Flamekeep, you're most likely a strong supporter of the cardinals and the theocracy. On the other hand, if you're from Breland, you might be more pragmatic, if not entirely corrupt. As a cleric who served in Sharn, you could potentially take the criminal background instead of acolyte; you no longer have significant influence in the church, but you still have friends in low places.

#### The Flametouched Folk Hero

You don't have to follow the faith of the Silver Flame to draw on its power. Tira Miron herself was a devout paladin of Dol Arrah when a couatl set her on the path to the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the Flame is a pool of divine energy that can empower anyone who seeks to defend the innocent from supernatural evils. If you're a paladin, it could be that your powers came to you unbidden when you leapt into danger to protect a group of strangers from a ghoul. Or it could be that you hear a voice guiding you on the path to virtue: is it the Voice of the Silver Flame? Or perhaps a couatl with a specific purpose for you? Either way, you could be a champion of the Silver Flame who not only has no ties to the church, but who doesn't even know anything about the faith or acknowledge it as the source of your divine power. The manifestations of your abilities will likely be obvious to any religious scholar; your spells might manifest with silvery radiance, and your *guardian of faith* could be a couatl. Are you simply ignorant of the source of your power, or do you have a different name or explanation for it?

#### The Ghaash'kala

The traditions of the Ghaash'kala are not only older than the modern Church of the Silver Flame, but predate human civilization itself. The warriors and priests of the Ghaash'kala guard the vast network of canyons that separate the Demon Wastes from the rest of Khorvaire, preventing both fiends and the barbarians of the Carrion Tribes from threatening innocents. The Ghaash'kala began as orcs, but over the course of centuries, members of other races have been drawn to this sacred duty. An outlander or hermit of any race--especially half-orcs--could assert that they served with the Ghaash'kala.

The Ghaash'kala revere Kalok Shash, "the Binding Flame." While they follow the same basic principles as other forms of the Silver Flame, they are fighting a brutal, never-ending war in a harsh and deadly land. As such, their focus is more on fighting supernatural evil than on using compassion to guide mortals to the light. Even so, they risk their lives every day to protect all mortals from the evils of the Wastes. They typically consider the people of "the south"--meaning everywhere south of the Demon Wastes--to be weak and naive, but still see it as their duty to protect these innocents from evil. They don't care that they receive no acknowledgment for their eternal vigilance; it is a war that must be fought.

As a character tied to the Ghaash'kala, consider why you've left your post and ventured south. Do you have a specific mission? Are you guided by divine visions? Or have you been exiled from the Wastes for some reason--and if so, have you shared the truth with your fellow adventurers?

#### The Pure Flame

An extremist branch of the Church of the Silver Flame, the Pure Flame rose in the aftermath of the Silver Crusade. Aundairians whose families had suffered through decades of lycanthropic terror embraced the Flame as the weapon of their liberation, but as a faith born in battle, they have a distorted view of its principles. The core principle of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent, but those who follow the Pure Flame see it as a tool to punish the wicked. They see no room for compassion; while they accept the idea that the overlords and the Shadow in the Flame drive people to do evil, they focus not on treating them with compassion, but on burning the evil out of them.

The primary defining traits of the Pure Flame are this harsh violence and uncompromising sense of justice. There must be no compromise with the wicked, and there is no hierarchy of evil; *no* evil deed can be tolerated. Most followers of the Pure Flame are exceptionally loyal to the Voice of the Flame and believe the Keeper to be a divine being. However, many also distrust the cardinals of Thrane, and should the Keeper make a proclamation that goes against their beliefs, they're quick to attribute it to the corrupt cardinals putting words in her mouth. A movement in Thaliost urges Archbishop Dariznu to rally forces and seize Flamekeep in order to "liberate the Keeper," though the Pure Flame doesn't have the forces, resources, or training to pull off something like this.

Members of the Pure Flame are intolerant, bigoted, and violent, rejecting the compassionate principles of the faith and denying that all are equal in the light of the Flame. However, because of their fanatical devotion to the fight against evil, they might offer adventurers assistance against a real supernatural threat. Purists are generally NPCs, not player characters, as their uncompromising and intolerant nature will likely cause clashes with other adventurers. That being said, a player character might be a former Purist seeking redemption for their vile behavior, or perhaps a young Aundarian rebelling against a Purist upbringing and broadening their horizons.

#### Serpent Cults

Serpent cults are the Silver Flame's oldest tradition, though they're virtually unknown in the present day. Rather than venerating the Flame itself, serpent cults honor the countless couatl whose sacrifice brought it into being. A common myth says that the couatl were formed by the last breath of Siberys, unleashed to contain Khyber's evil. These cults maintain that the Silver Flame was formed when the couatl sacrificed their individual existence and bound their celestial energy together to bind the overlords; research suggests that this is true, though it's not in the common doctrine of the church. Rather than revering a Voice or Keeper of the Flame, the serpent cults listen for the guidance of couatl themselves. A few couatl did remain separate from the Flame in order to serve as guardians or carry out specific missions, and it's also possible for couatl to temporarily serve as spiritual guides; this was the case with Tira Miron, and could also be the case with an aasimar tied to the Silver Flame.

As a member of a serpent cult, the hermit background can be a good option to reflect that you possess secret knowledge about the Silver Flame that the modern church knows nothing about. If you're tied to a serpent cult, work with your DM to determine its size, origin, and influence. Is your sect a band of six people living in the Blade Desert, or are you tied to the Shulassakar--a race of rainbow-feathered yuan-ti who have been watching from the shadows for millennia? Do you have a specific mission? Or do you have a less-spiritual reason for adventuring, despite your unusual faith?

## The Blood of Vol: Divinity Within

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/57%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

Life is pain, a ceaseless struggle against hunger, disease, and despair. Every day we're one step closer to the grave, and all that lies beyond is Dolurrh and the disintegration of the soul. What just god would create such a world? What benevolent Sovereign would condemn their creations to such misery?

But what if mortality is something that can be overcome? Perhaps we all have a spark of divinity within us, a spark that can become a force to rival the Silver Flame. Perhaps one day we can end the cycle of death and misery, so all can live long enough to find their divinity within. Until then, the best we can do is to hold our family and friends close, defy cruel fate, and fight to live as long as we can.

This is the message of the Blood of Vol. Life is suffering and death is annihilation, but you can defy this cruel fate--and perhaps even break the cycle for good.

### Foundations of the Faith

Most followers of the Blood of Vol identify as Seekers of the Divinity Within--usually shortened to Seekers--though there are other traditions within the faith. The Blood of Vol has long been vilified, with outsiders often viewing it as a death cult, falsely equating it with the cult of Katashka the Gatekeeper (described later in this chapter), or blaming its members for plagues and blights. In the midst of misinformation and fear, what is the truth of the Blood of Vol?

#### Born in Khorvaire

Human settlers to Khorvaire brought the faith of the Sovereign Host with them, but the Blood of Vol is indigenous to the continent. The line of Vol was a noble line of Aerenal, as described in chapter 2, with a long tradition of necromancy tracing its roots back to Xen'drik. When members of the line of Vol developed the dragonmark known as the Mark of Death, they undertook a risky series of experiments designed to unlock its full powers. This ended when the Undying Court and the dragons of Argonnessen joined forces to eradicate the bloodlines that carried the Mark of Death. In the aftermath of this brutal purge, those elves who had supported Vol but didn't bear its blood were given the choice of exile or swearing fealty to the Sibling Kings of Aerenal. This resulted in a wave of exiled elves settling in the Lhazaar Principalities and spreading west into the lands that are now Karrnath.

These exiles brought the knowledge of necromancy along with stories of how the heroic family of Vol had sought to attain godhood, only to be destroyed by the jealous gods. The people of the region knew nothing of Aereni traditions or dragonmarks, and they blended this story with their own experience of life in a harsh land, local tyrants, and the empty promises of Sovereign priests. And in the process, they somehow discovered something real. The line of Vol had never sought the divinity within, but these first priests found it, drawing divine power from their own conviction and their own souls.

So despite its name, the religion was never practiced by the line of Vol, nor by the infamous Erandis Vol herself, who was in hiding during the period in which the faith evolved. It is a faith born of the blending of elf and human myths and traditions. While the faithful believe that "Vol" was the first person to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality, the faith is based around the divinity within each of us, not the worship of this mythical Vol. Even devoted priests of Vol do not know Erandis Vol's identity, though they respect the name of "Vol" as author of their core texts, believing that this Vol challenged the Sovereigns, then was subsequently destroyed by these jealous gods--a martyr of the faith. Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all. So if Erandis Vol were to proclaim her true identity, many of the faithful would be impressed by her lineage, but her bloodline alone wouldn't give her divine authority.

#### Always in Opposition

Millennia ago, as the faith of the Blood of Vol emerged in pre-Galifar Khorvaire, it stood in opposition to the dominant beliefs and authorities of the time. The tyrannical leaders asserted that the Sovereigns blessed their bloodlines and their rule. By challenging the benevolence of the Sovereigns, these early Seekers were also challenging the despots of the time. As time marched on and those petty tyrants fell, the Sovereign Host remained the dominant faith of humanity in Khorvaire, and the philosophical divide between Seeker and Vassal only grew.

The Seekers were also shunned for their use of necromancy, generally considered taboo and said to be condemned by Aureon and Dol Arrah. This prejudice grew worse with the rise of Galifar and the Church of the Silver Flame, which asserted that undead are inherently anathema and drain the life from the world by their very existence. In turn, this caused people to blame plagues and blights on the Seekers. However, the Blood of Vol is a faith grounded in the principle of an oppressive universe, and it endured in spite of this prejudice and persecution. But it never spread far beyond the harsh lands where it began, and Seekers are often still met with fear and suspicion today.

#### Stronger Together

>>The universe is against us, and all we have is each other.
>>

This is one of the most basic principles of the Blood of Vol. Despite its grim outlook, it is a faith that emphasizes the value of friendship, family, and community. There are no benevolent gods looking out for us, so we have to look out for each other. Death is the end, so we can't let it steal the people we care about without a fight. And since there is no pleasant afterlife waiting for us, we should treasure the time we have with those we love. These values have kept the Blood of Vol alive through the centuries: the deep commitment to community and to working together even in the face of impossible odds.

#### The Divinity Within

>>Divinity lies within our blood.
>>

In the eyes of the Seeker, life and the soul are both divine forces. Every soul has the potential to evolve and develop divine power--but this takes time and willpower, and most mortals die before they accomplish it.

As a divine spellcaster who follows the Blood of Vol, you believe that your power comes from your own soul. As a paladin, you are calling on the power of your own blood when you heal your allies or smite your enemies. The visible manifestations of magic of the Blood of Vol typically involve crimson energy, as if luminous tendrils of blood are flowing from you. But it's not simply your power. Consider the Seeker priest who casts *commune*; how can they gain information they don't already know? The answer is that the divinity within is something far greater than you. It is a god, possessing celestial power you can't understand or imagine--but it is still in its chrysalis, waiting to be born. When you cast your spell, you awaken a sliver of its power; once the spell is done, it returns to its rest.

Or at least, that's what a Seeker believes. Scholars of other faiths argue that the Seekers are deluded, that their powers are simply drawn from some other source, the same kind of delusion that allows a warforged cleric to draw magic from their devotion to the Lord of Blades. However, Seeker priests can reverse this same argument. What proof is there that all clerics aren't simply drawing on their own divine sparks--that even a paladin of Dol Arrah mistakenly thinks their power come from above, when really, it's always come from within?

#### Necromancy and the Undead

The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what's left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community--why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.

However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years--but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.

Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones--so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them.

> ##### Celestials, Fiends, and the Blood of Vol
>
>If the power of the Blood of Vol flows from within, who answers when a cleric conjures a celestial or invokes *planar ally*? One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it's a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for *planar ally*, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious--a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you've been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don't fully understand what it needs or wants.

>Another possibility is that you're drawing on the Seeker community rather than reaching to the planes for assistance. One principle of the faith is that champions become undead so that they can help other Seekers. When you cast *planar ally*, rather than calling a celestial or fiend, you might summon an undead champion of your faith; this could be anything from a vampire to a mummy lord or a death knight. In this case, the payment they demand for their service would likely be a tithe to the Seeker temple they are bound to. On a smaller scale, your DM could similarly decide that when you cast *conjure celestial*, it summons a sarcastic flameskull instead of an angel.

#### War and Peace

Throughout its history, the Blood of Vol has been treated with fear and suspicion by the people of the Five Nations. It's a faith that has dwelled in the shadows. This changed early in the Last War. His nation crippled by famine, King Kaius I accepted the aid of the Blood of Vol. The Seekers provided undead soldiers and necromantic expertise; with the resources of the crown behind them, Seekers developed necromantic rituals and weapons never before imagined. In exchange, Kaius elevated the Blood of Vol to the official state religion. Warlords were encouraged to embrace the faith, and Seeker families were given lands and titles.

For a time, the Blood of Vol spread and was celebrated--or so it seemed. Most of the old warlord families still despised the Seekers and felt that the use of undead in battle debased the proud martial traditions of their ancestors. Toward the end of the war, Regent Moranna turned on the faith and the Blood of Vol became a scapegoat for all of Karrnath's troubles. Moranna claimed that the famines and plagues the people had suffered were caused by the Seekers. Its nobles were stripped of their lands. Chivalric orders of Seekers were disbanded. Some--notably the infamous Order of the Emerald Claw--refused to surrender, but most Seekers remained loyal to their nation even when it betrayed them.

Today, the Blood of Vol has returned to the shadows, though there are still Seekers who serve the crown. Kaius III has sealed most of his undead forces in the crypts below Korth and Atur, but he isn't willing to entirely surrender this strategic advantage. Fort Bones and Fort Zombie remain bastions of loyal Seekers. But the faith is no longer celebrated, and the old warlord lines still mutter that they would have won the war if only they'd relied on skill and steel instead of foul magics. In playing a Karrnathi Seeker, do you support the crown and believe that Kaius III is only doing what he has to do to maintain the support of the warlords, or do you despise Kaius III and Moranna for betraying your faith?

### Paths of the Faith

When creating a player character or NPC associated with the Blood of Vol, consider the following paths and which best fits your character.

#### The Seekers of the Divinity Within

The Seekers of the Divinity Within are the largest and most widespread tradition associated with the Blood of Vol. The faith isn't as formally structured as the Church of the Silver Flame or even the Sovereign Host. For the most part, Seekers keep to themselves, living in their own villages and small towns or in isolated neighborhoods of larger communities, where they can practice their traditions without drawing the ire of their neighbors. The exception is the city of Atur: known as the City of Night, this remains the most public bastion of the Blood of Vol. Expanded and fortified during the Last War, Atur is the seat of Karrnath's necromantic research and development. While Kaius III has stripped the Blood of Vol of much of its standing, he still recognizes its potential value should the war begin anew, and many believe that he continues to provide support to Atur. The mummy lord Hass Malevanor is the high priest of Atur and the current spiritual leader of the faith. However, there are stories of undead champions who have guided and protected the Seekers for centuries. Sometimes known as the Crimson Covenant, these enigmatic figures may be the true power behind Atur.

Outside Atur, for the most part, each Seeker community relies on their abactor--the priest that oversees a temple or community--and they rarely reach out to the world beyond. The largest temple in a region serves as a hub, coordinating with the other Seeker communities around it. But every community has its own stories and traditions and they're generally unconcerned with "heresy"; feel free to develop your character's own unique beliefs.

As an acolyte of the Blood of Vol, you've been ordained as a priest, but not bound to a single community as an abactor. You can receive shelter in any Seeker community. Are you following orders from Malevanor or the Crimson Covenant itself? Are you guided by visions from your own divinity within? As a Seeker hermit, you spent your time in isolation communing with your divinity within, and your Discovery may relate to the faith. Perhaps you have an insight into how to unlock your own power. Or perhaps you've learned a secret about the Crimson Covenant, and believe that a malevolent force is manipulating the faithful Seekers--can you find a way to bring down this ancient evil and free your people?

#### The Bloodsails

The elves of the Bloodsail Principality occupy the island of Farlnen in the Lhazaar Principalities. The Bloodsails share the same roots as the Blood of Vol, as the principality was founded by Aereni exiles. However, they have followed a different path and hewn closer to the traditions of their ancestors. They don't believe in the divinity within and readily seek immortality through undeath. However, the island can only support a limited number of vampires, and Bloodsails must earn their afterlife by paying *velgys*--blood money--to the lords of the land. Those who fail to earn enough to buy a better afterlife are instead bound to objects after death. This is similar to the Aereni techniques described in chapter 2, but Bloodsail elves are often tied to ships and sails, enabling their vessels to move across a windless sea, sails driven by ghosts.

Bloodsail elves often bear crimson tattoos that are tied to their families and vessels. The Bloodsails are exceptional sailors, so both sailor and pirate are logical backgrounds for a player character. Most Bloodsails use the Aereni elf subrace provided in chapter 6. As an adventurer, you might have been exiled from your island, or you could be searching for a way to quickly earn the blood money you need to leave mortality behind.

#### The Order of the Emerald Claw

The Order of the Emerald Claw began as an elite military force comprised of devoted Seekers. When Regent Moranna turned on the Blood of Vol, the Emerald Claw refused to stand down. Today, members of the order include both Seeker extremists and Karrnathi patriots furious at Kaius III for embracing peace. The ultimate leader of the Emerald Claw is the lich known to most as the Queen of the Dead, though those in the inner circle know her to be the infamous Lady Illmarrow of Farlnen. She claims that her violent actions are for the good of Karrnath and the Blood of Vol, but in truth, they primarily benefit her and serve to spread terror.

The Order of the Emerald Claw is full of villains whose actions have cast all Seekers in a bad light, and most Seekers despise the Emerald Claw. If you have ties to the Emerald Claw, you could have served with them before realizing that the Queen of the Dead is pursuing her own evil agenda; if so, you could be determined to find some way to destroy the lich and restore honor to the order. Or you could be convinced that Lady Illmarrow truly does have the best interests of your people at heart. Has she been unjustly vilified? Or are you simply a tool?

If you wish to play a Seeker veteran without the villainous ties of the Emerald Claw, the Order of the Onyx Skull was another elite unit comprised of Seekers, but disbanded on Moranna's orders. As a paladin of the Blood of Vol, you could be a knight of the Onyx Skull who has taken up adventuring after being cast aside by your nation. Are you still loyal to Karrnath? Or do you believe Kaius III is a traitor to your people?

#### Thieves of Life

The Seekers of the Divinity Within value community, urging the faithful to stand together. But there are others who follow the principles of the Blood of Vol who prefer to stand alone. The hermits known as Thieves of Life are determined to unlock their divinity within at any cost--not to help others, but solely to further their own quest for power and immortality. Thieves of Life are often master necromancers, but never become undead themselves; instead, they specialize in magics that allow them to drain the life from their foes.

As a hermit devoted to the Blood of Vol, you could choose the path of the Thief of Life. You are utterly devoted to the pursuit of your personal divinity, and your Discovery has likely shown you the path you must take. You might be a cleric, a Divine Soul sorcerer, or an Undying warlock (with your patron being your own nascent divinity within). What binds you to your fellow adventurers, and why would they choose to associate with you? You may be utterly devoted to your quest for immortality--but what is your redeeming feature, your anchor to humanity?

An unusual option for a Thief of Life hermit is to say that you've actually been in a state of suspended animation for decades or even centuries--your Discovery was made on an inner journey. You were once far more powerful than you are today, but your powers have yet to return; as you gain levels, you are actually regaining the power you once had. If this is the case, it could be that one or more of your adventuring companions are actually descendants of yours; while you're obsessed with your quest for immortality, you also care about your own bloodline.

## Sovereigns and Six: Shaping the World

![Artist: Simon Zhong](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/60%20simon%20zhong.png)

The Sovereigns and Six are all around us, their hands shaping the world. Onatar stands by the smith at the forge, ready to guide their hands. Dol Dorn is on the battlefield with every soldier. Give thanks to Arawai for the gentle rain that helps the harvest--and curse the Devourer for the storms that devastate your fields. The Dark Six are also with us, urging us to stray from the righteous path and give way to cruelty and greed, but we must let the Sovereigns guide our actions and thank them for their blessings.

The Sovereign Host isn't a demanding religion, and there are many cultural variations and unique sects across Khorvaire. As a follower of this faith, you could feel an especially strong connection to a single deity, or you could have a general reverence for the pantheon as a whole. Do you believe that there is a particular Sovereign who guides your actions? Was there a key moment in your life where you felt the hand of one of the Sovereigns or Six?

### Foundations of the Faith

Followers of the Sovereign Host are generally called Vassals, but despite the shared name, they are anything but monolithic. Variations of the Sovereign Host can be found across Eberron in many different cultures--the Pyrinean Creed of humanity, the Rushemé faith of the giants of Xen'drik, the Cazhaak traditions of Droaam. Precise names and groupings change, but the faith's basic principles remain the same.

#### Distant yet Omnipresent

The Sovereigns don't walk the world. No one expects to meet Dol Dorn in the flesh. To do so would, in fact, be unnecessary and limiting. You don't expect to meet Dol Dorn because you know he is with you every time a blade is drawn, ready to guide your hand. Aureon watches over the wizard studying magic and the judge presiding in court. The Devourer is present in every storm, and you can't fight him any more than you can defeat an earthquake with a sword. A true Vassal doesn't need proof of the Sovereigns' existence for the world itself is the proof.

With that said, many myths depict the Sovereigns in the flesh, performing heroic acts and setting particular elements of creation in motion. These myths are set during the Age of Demons, and Vassal doctrine maintains that the Sovereigns defeated and bound the fiendish overlords. As the overlords previously ruled reality, once they were defeated, the Sovereigns ascended to fill that role. So there are stories of Dol Dorn performing tremendous feats of strength, and you might find an artifact said to be Onatar's hammer; but these date back to a mythic age when they were champions, not yet true Sovereigns.

Every culture depicts the Sovereigns in different ways. The giants depict them as giants while the Pyrinean Creed (discussed in a later section) depicts them as humans. Many cultures use draconic imagery to represent the Sovereigns. But since the Sovereigns don't manifest physically, any representation of them is purely symbolic. Dol Dorn is the Warrior, Onatar is the Smith--any image that clearly depicts these concepts will do.

#### A Personal Experience

The Sovereigns are everywhere, offering guidance to anyone who will listen. Due to the personal nature of this faith, it doesn't have the same degree of organization and hierarchy as the Silver Flame. A large community generally has an eight-sided temple to the Sovereign Host, staffed by full-time priests. In smaller villages and towns, there might be an untended shrine or a local person who is considered to be especially close to a Sovereign and performs ceremonies. In the town of Riverford, the innkeeper Dara is said to speak with Boldrei's voice; she's the pillar of the community, and people come to her with their problems and disputes.

A Sovereign priest's role isn't simply as an intermediary to the divine; anyone can talk to the Sovereigns. Instead, priests offer guidance and clarity, helping you understand the path you're on. A temple or priest often serves another function beyond their religious duties; the Great Hall of Aureon in Sharn is a library as well as a temple, while you might find a shrine to Kol Korran at the center of the public market. Priests serve as teachers, mediators, and guides, but they are often also subject matter experts in the path tied to the Sovereign they serve.

In creating a Vassal character, think about your personal relationship to the Sovereigns. Who do you feel particularly close to? Do you feel you are blessed or directly guided by a Sovereign? Is there a point in your life where you believe one of the Sovereigns intervened on your behalf?

#### The Founding Faith

When human settlers came from Sarlona, they brought the Sovereign Host with them. While some traditions have evolved over the course of centuries and civilizations, the Pyrinean interpretation of the Sovereigns is part of the very foundation of the Five Nations, and its creed is reflected in their values. You should follow the laws (Aureon) and value the traditions of your community (Boldrei). Industry (Onatar) and commerce (Kol Korran) are encouraged, though greed (the Keeper) is not. On the battlefield, you should fight with courage (Dol Dorn) and honor (Dol Arrah), while not engaging in needless cruelty (the Mockery). You should trust in Aureon's laws and not take vengeance into your own hands (the Fury).

Beyond these basic values, the Sovereigns are ubiquitous in the Five Nations. When you go into a courtroom, you stand on an Eye of Aureon. Standard marriage ceremonies invoke Boldrei. Many people aren't devoted Vassals and don't actually believe the Sovereigns are guiding their every action. But even such pragmatists recall the names of each Sovereign, know many of their songs, and will celebrate Wildnight or Boldrei's Feast. By and large, if you live in the Five Nations, it's assumed you're a Vassal unless you specifically say you're not.

#### Endless Diversity

The giants of Xen'drik raised temples to Ouralon Lawbringer long before humanity embraced Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Hunters in Aundair give thanks to Balinor, but orcs in the Shadow Marches invoke Baalkan the Beastlord, while the Talenta halflings tell stories of clever Bally-Nur.

Some of this is a natural process of syncretism. The Marcher orcs blended their original beliefs with the traditions of human settlers. But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name--and if the deity's name is similar to "Balinor," the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game--it's easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.

Because of this diversity, Vassal priests are rarely concerned with heresy. Those who follow the Pyrinean Creed may attempt to correct what they see as flawed beliefs, but ultimately, most just smile at the ignorance of the Marcher orc, content in the knowledge that *they* know the proper names of the Sovereigns. Likewise, while player characters and NPCs may choose to follow one of the paths described below, you can always develop a unique twist on tradition or introduce a new cult that worships a specific grouping of Sovereigns. This openness is also reflected in Vassal interactions with the Church of the Silver Flame. The Pyrinean Creed asserts that the Sovereigns defeated the overlords at the dawn of time; if the Silver Flame is what keeps the overlords bound, presumably the Sovereigns created it. So there's no inherent conflict; rather, a Vassal will simply shrug and say, "But why do you worship a cage?"

### Paths of the Faith

The Sovereigns are worshiped in many different configurations and forms. A particular community could be devoted to a single Sovereign, or it could present a Sovereign and member of the Dark Six as being allied forces (as seen with the Restful Watch). A few of the best-known variants are described below.

#### The Pyrinean Creed

The standard names and attributes of the Sovereigns and Six as presented in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*--Aureon, Balinor, the Shadow--are drawn from the Pyrinean Creed, the dominant tradition within the Five Nations. This is the source of the Octogram symbol, the division of Nine and Six, and holy days like Boldrei's Feast. If you follow the Pyrinean Creed, you believe in the faith as it's presented in the core Eberron sourcebooks. You recognize all of the Sovereigns and Six, even if you may feel that one in particular is especially influential in your life.

While the common faithful know the term "Pyrinean Creed," its history is largely only of interest to scholars and priests. A typical Vassal might know that they believe in the Pyrinean Creed, but if you asked five of them what Pyrine was, you'd get five different answers--"He was a legendary missionary!" "It was an old town in Daskara where there was a council!" In reality, these beliefs were codified thousands of years ago in the Sarlonan nation of Pyrine, then carried to Khorvaire by human settlers. While Pyrine was assimilated by the Empire of Riedra over a thousand years ago and its people no longer worship the Sovereign Host, their legacy lives on in Khorvaire.

*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* assigns domains to individual Sovereigns, but Pyrinean priests can often perform the rites of any Sovereign, invoking the deity most appropriate to the current situation. In creating a Sovereign cleric, you can assert that you have a close tie to a particular Sovereign and primarily speak on their behalf; in this case, use the domain associated with that Sovereign. For example, the Life domain is a good option for a cleric who speaks for all Sovereigns equally, as it provides a general ability to protect your allies and community; and the Knowledge domain makes sense for a priest who's more scholar than warrior.

#### The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant

The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant worships the Sovereigns in the same groupings and names as the Pyrinean Creed. However, the church asserts that the champions who fought the overlords were dragons, depicting them as such. The church is very focused on wealth and economic power; members are expected to contribute to the hoard of their local temple, and the priests often engage in behavior that outsiders might consider to be corrupt. They hold the unorthodox belief that mortals can ascend to become Sovereigns themselves--that by emulating a particular Sovereign, a mortal can eventually take their place. Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon. While this Sovereign ascension is believed to occur after death, some priests teach that devoted members--especially those who donate great sums to the temple hoard--can actually become dragons in life. While this seems unlikely, it could be an interesting background for a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer; it's not that you have draconic ancestry, but rather, due to your devotion, you appear to be evolving into a dragon.

Wyrm Ascendant Vassals believe the dragons themselves are divine tools and emissaries of the Sovereigns and Six, though few dragons have ever acknowledged the church in any way. It's thought that the dragons themselves follow a form of this faith known as Thir--Draconic for "three"--but the traditions of Argonnessen are rarely revealed to people of Khorvaire.

The Wyrm Ascendant is strongest in Aundair and Zilargo, though it remains an obscure sect, and has noteworthy temples in Stormreach, Korranberg, and Fairhaven.

#### The Restful Watch

Priests of the Restful Watch specialize in embalming, funerals, and cemetery maintenance. They can be found in every major city in the Five Nations, and even smaller towns may have a devotee of the Watch tending the boneyard. The Restful Watch maintains that the souls of the dead pass through Dolurrh into the realm of the Sovereigns--unless they are snatched by the Keeper's greedy talons. One of a priest's most important duties is helping bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or sacrifices sufficient to distract the Keeper and ensure the deceased's soul reaches Dolurrh. For a simple person with few achievements, a single coin might suffice. But the more remarkable the deceased, the greater interest the Keeper will have in their soul--requiring a more significant sacrifice to distract him.

Faithful of the Watch rarely discuss another aspect of their faith with outsiders--that once a soul rises to the realm of the Sovereigns, it can never return. The Restful Watch believes that if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, so it can be restored when the time is right. Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.

Members of the Watch often serve as mediums and exorcists, considering it a sacred duty to lay restless spirits to rest. Clerics associated with the Restful Watch usually take the Grave Domain, though the Knowledge and Death domains are also options. Paladins of the Watch typically take Oaths of Devotion or Redemption, but those with an especially deep understanding of the Keeper might be represented by the Oathbreaker.

Two other roles within the Restful Watch could be interesting options for a player character. The Restful Watch believes that Aureon is preserving the souls of heroes in preparation for an apocalyptic conflict that lies ahead. It's said that this will involve the collapse of the Silver Flame and the subsequent unleashing of the dreadful overlords. You may have been sent out in the world to watch for signs that this conflict is coming to pass; this could require you to investigate the Mournland or clash with the Lords of Dust.

The Restful Watch also occasionally identifies people they believe Aureon has marked as a hero whose soul will be preserved. This could be one of your fellow adventurers--and as an acolyte or sage of the Restful Watch, you've been assigned to follow this person around, chronicling their life and making sure to perform the appropriate rituals when they die. "Don't mind me, I'm just going to follow you around until your heroic death. Trust me, you're going to accomplish amazing things!"

#### The Three Faces

Followers of the Pyrinean Creed honor the Sovereigns and are encouraged to shun the Dark Six. The Six embody dark forces that have no place in a virtuous society. However, over the course of centuries, there have always been cults to challenge this view. The Three Faces cults serve two purposes. On the one hand, they honor particular groupings of the Sovereigns and Six, asserting that there are members of the Six with something valuable to offer worshippers. Beyond this, the cults are also secret societies--a form of fraternal order that binds people together even if they aren't truly invested in the religious aspects of the cult. For example, the Three Faces of War can be found in all of the armies of the Five Nations.

***The Three Faces of Coin.*** honors Kol Korran, Onatar, and Kol Turrant (the Keeper). This cult operates in major cities, usually recruiting merchants, smugglers, and captains of industry. It is based on the idea that while honest trade and industry form the core of commerce, there should always be a way for people to get what they desire; thus, it is a neutral ground where criminals and guild artisans can work together. The Aurum often recruits members from the Three Faces of Coin.

***The Three Faces of Love.*** honors Boldrei, Arawai, and Szorawai (the Fury)--the Love that Binds, the Love that Brings Life, and the Love that Burns. This cult embraces all who believe in and wield the power of love, from actors to poets to paid companions. Members gather to share stories and change lives; the cult excels at matchmaking and at disrupting important relationships they consider to be doomed.

***The Three Faces of War.*** honors Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and Dol Azur (the Mockery). It was part of the united armies of Galifar, and cult chapters can be found in all of the armies of the Five Nations. Sect meetings provide a place for soldiers and veterans to interact as friends and equals, regardless of rank or nationality. The cult asserts that honor and courage are to be valued, but there is also a time and place for cunning and cruelty, even if it is never to be desired.

***The Three Faces of the Wild.*** honors Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (the Devourer). Sects are usually found in rural communities, and include farmers, hunters, and all manner of wanderers. The Three Faces of the Wild supports agriculture and hunting, but recognizes that the wild cannot be fully tamed. Members sometimes engage in ritual sacrifices or the burning of fields or other acts of destruction. They believe that the Devourer must have his due--and by making their chosen offerings, they keep him from striking elsewhere.

> ##### Celestials and the Sovereign Host
>
>When priests of the Sovereign Host cast spells such as *commune* or *planar ally*, they usually interact with celestials from the planes. Typically, this is a celestial that embodies the same concept as the Sovereign in question; when a Vassal priest casts *conjure celestial* in Dol Arrah's name, a warlike angel may come from Shavarath. When a celestial speaks the name of a Sovereign, listeners will hear the name they are most familiar with, whether that's Balinor, Baalkan, or Bally-Nur. As such, some scholars assert that it's slightly unclear if a summoned angel serves "Dol Arrah," or if it instead serves "Honor in War" and it's just being translated as Dol Arrah. If asked such a pedantic question, both the angel and a devout Vassal might simply respond with, "What's the difference? Dol Arrah is honor in war."
>

### The Dark Six in the World

The Sovereigns embody pillars of civilization: agriculture, commerce, industry, honor, law. The Dark Six represent frightening and destructive forces, their existence explaining why bad things happen in the world. When a wildfire destroys a village, the Devourer is to blame. When someone commits a crime of passion, they were overcome by the Fury. When monsters prey on the innocent, good people curse the Shadow.

The Pyrinean Creed exhorts that the Dark Six should be shunned, teaching their names and aspects so that people can recognize their works and understand how to resist them. When Pyrinean Vassals do make offerings to the Dark Six, it's usually as an act of desperation: begging the Devourer to calm storm-tossed waters or calling on the Fury to enact a terrible revenge when the law has failed. However, there are those in the Five Nations and beyond who see the Dark Six as powers to be respected and worshiped in their own right. This section presents a brief overview of the Dark Six and how their followers can be encountered in the Five Nations. These descriptions expand on the material presented in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*, further developing the roles of these deities. The monsters of Droaam also have a quite different view of the Sovereigns and Six, explored in more detail in chapter 4.

#### The Devourer

- **Province:** Nature's wrath
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Nature, Tempest
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Ancients

The Devourer is the tsunami that overwhelms the tallest ship, the wildfire that consumes the grandest castle, the earthquake that levels the most glorious city. He is the vast and primordial power of nature, a force that will break any chain and wear down the strongest wall. The Devourer is the glorious cruelty that drives the predator, the cry of the hawk and the howl of the wolf. He is all that is wild, savage, and unknowable. He is the deepest ocean, a force that can be crossed but never controlled.

Those who fear the Devourer see him as an entirely destructive force. Arawai is the patron of agriculture, of peacefully harvesting nature's bounty. Balinor is the patron of the hunt, of civilized folk using bow, spear, and skill to challenge or tame the mightiest beasts. These deities reflect the power of civilization to harness and control the natural world, but the Devourer puts the lie to this, showing that nature will never be truly tamed.

Those who embrace the Devourer celebrate the glorious power of the wilds. They revel in the raging storm and gladly embrace their predatory instincts. They accept that nature is often bloody and cruel, and don't hesitate to follow its example. But while it may be harsh, nature is rarely evil. Priests of the Devourer often urge their parishioners to follow their instincts, or teach people to live in accord with nature instead of forcing their will upon it. They may serve as intermediaries, convincing the Devourer to redirect his wrath and spare their followers--or to turn his rage against their enemies.

#### The Fury

- **Province:** Passion, revenge
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** War
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Vengeance

The Fury is a silent whisper that can drive you to doubt or despair. She is reckless rage and all-consuming passion. Instinct is the voice of the Fury, guiding us when rational thought fails. And she is the Sovereign of revenge, promising vengeance to those willing to surrender to her. Her father the Devourer embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control.

Devotees of the Fury generally follow one of two paths. Revelers believe that suppressing emotion causes anguish, and that people should embrace their emotions fully and act on impulse and instinct. They hold wild, ecstatic celebrations as a way for participants to throw off the chains of civilization for a moment and experience life and emotion fully. A player character who follows this path might be a Berserker barbarian or a bard using the College of Glamour--either embracing their own primal emotion or inspiring it in others. A sorcerer might attribute their power to wild emotion; they can only access their magic when they let the Fury guide them.

The other path of the Fury is the road of revenge. People who have suffered grievously can call on the Fury to give them the will and strength to take vengeance into their own hands. Or rather than seeking revenge themselves, one tradition calls for someone who has been wronged to place a red candle in a window, inscribed with the name of their tormentor. This is an invitation for the Fury to take vengeance on their behalf. A player character following this path could be charged to investigate and fulfill these calls for revenge. While this could be the path of a cleric or paladin, it could just as easily suit an Assassin rogue, a bard of the College of Whispers, or a warlock.

#### The Keeper

- **Province:** Death, greed, hoarding
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Death, Trickery
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Oathbreaker

Every Vassal knows they should never flaunt good fortune, avoiding arrogance and pride. Those who crow too loudly may catch the jealous eye of the Keeper. Even the mightiest hero can be laid low by disease or ill fortune, as the Keeper has a vast arsenal to bring down those that he desires. Once he pulls you down into the darkness, he will snatch your soul before it can reach Dolurrh and add you to his endless hoard, where he can toy with you and torment you until the end of time.

The Keeper is the patron of those who put personal gain above all else. He guides those who use guile to gain gold, regardless of the cost to others. A rogue who invokes Olladra sees themselves as the hero of the story; one who calls on the Keeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals--though his bargains are always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make these deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are often abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could bargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for fame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous, there's no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to anticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die. This could easily be a part of the backstory of a player character. Did your entertainer make a bargain with the Keeper?

Another possible path for a player character or deadly NPC is that of being a Keeper's Fang. These people receive visions of things that the Keeper wishes to add to his hoard; these are usually the souls of specific people, but they could also be artifacts or other unique treasures. This is an interesting path for an Assassin rogue, an Oathbreaker paladin, or a Hexblade warlock.

#### The Mockery

- **Province:** Betrayal and bloodshed
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Trickery, War
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Conquest, Vengeance

Dol Arrah will show you how to fight with honor, Dol Dorn will grant you courage, and when you die, at least you'll know you did so bravely and honorably. The Mockery will drag you through mud and blood, drive you to betray your principles and employ tactics that horrify your allies and enemies alike--but at the end of the day, you'll be standing over the corpse of your foe. Which path will you follow?

Those who despise the Dark Six condemn the Mockery as a villain, a monster who encourages cruel and treacherous behavior. This can be as simple as ambushing an enemy, using stealth instead of facing them openly. Or it can mean slaughtering innocents, torturing your foes, breaking a truce--anything to bring you victory. Those who embrace the path of the Mockery may say that such tactics are the only way to bring down a superior foe. Honor is a luxury for the strong; for those who are weak and oppressed, victory is all that truly matters.

Others who follow the Mockery assert that the very idea of honor in war is delusional. Pain, terror, and death are the inevitable results of violence; at least those who follow the Mockery acknowledge the truth others deny. The assassin who kills without warning, the barbarian who sees mercy as a weakness, the pirate who cultivates a terrifying reputation--all these might view the Mockery as an ally. While this can be a dark path for a player character to follow, a hero could use the techniques of the Mockery in pursuit of a noble cause. A grim vigilante who uses stealth and fear to terrify cowardly criminals into changing their ways could be guided by the Mockery.

#### The Shadow

- **Province:** Ambition and temptation, forbidden knowledge, monsters
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Arcana, Knowledge, Trickery
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Conquest, Oathbreaker

The war between the Shadow and Aureon rages in all of us. Aureon's voice tells us that we are stronger together, that it's worth it to suffer for the sake of the common good. The Shadow whispers that there is no common good--all that matters is what you need and what you can do. Why should you make sacrifices for others instead of doing what's best for yourself? Why should you give when you can take?

The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition. Those who revere it view this as a positive trait; the Shadow will show you how to be the best you can be. But how far will you go in pursuit of your ambition? What--or who--will you sacrifice? Priests who embrace this aspect of the Shadow call themselves Mentors, emphasizing that they can show you how to achieve your full potential; others call them Tempters, as they will always drive you down the darkest path. The Pyrinean Creed says that the Shadow consumes the souls of those who fall prey to its temptation; a Mentor will tell you that this is exactly the sort of lie the Sovereigns use to trick you into following their rules.

The Shadow is also the keeper of forbidden knowledge, of secrets you know you shouldn't pursue. This includes arcane magic--granting powers virtuous people should shun (see the Forbidden Magic sidebar for ideas about this). Any spellcasting character could attribute their powers to the Shadow; a wizard might have been struggling with their studies, but after a sacrifice to the Shadow, they awoke with new insights. The Shadow can also serve as a warlock's patron, likely in the role of the Fiend or the Hexblade. While the Shadow won't interact directly with a warlock, they could receive visions like a priest; they could interact with a fiend who claims to speak for the Shadow; or they could be mistaken about the nature of their patron, and actually be bound to the overlord Sul Khatesh.

In addition to mystical knowledge, priests of the Shadow often know things they simply shouldn't know--secrets that can harm people if revealed. Priests of the Shadow can sometimes be found working as fixers in the criminal underworld; how much are you willing to pay for the knowledge you seek?

Beyond all this, the Shadow is seen as a corrupting force that creates monsters, both figuratively through temptation, and literally--it is said to have created many of the monstrosities that prey on innocents. In turn, many monstrous creatures see the Shadow as their patron.

> ##### Optional Rule: Forbidden Magic
>
>The Shadow tempts you to perform evil actions and can teach spells no one should know. While the game's rules aren't designed with the idea of forbidden spells that shouldn't be cast, a DM could choose to grant a character one or more additional spells that have dangerous or unpleasant side effects every time they're cast. Or the Shadow could grant a spellcaster the ability to increase the power of any spell they know--as if it was cast using a higher-level spell slot--once per long rest, but in doing this, it triggers a negative effect.
>
>Regardless of what effects you establish, they should illustrate a clear and concrete reason why this magic is forbidden. Someone or something will pay a price every time this magic is used. Consider the following ideas:
>
>- When you cast the spell, roll a d6. The DM chooses you or one of your allies, either dealing the result as necrotic damage or applying it as a penalty to that creature's next saving throw.
>- When you cast the spell, an innocent creature dies. You have no control over who will suffer and may never know who it is.
>- When you cast the spell, plants wither and all living creatures within 15 feet of you take one point of necrotic damage.
>- When you cast the spell, choose an ally within sight. That player can reveal a disturbing secret about their character to you. This must be worse than any previous secret they've revealed; if they can't or if they choose not to, the spell fails.
>- When you cast the spell, the effect of the spell itself is particularly horrifying.

#### The Traveler

- **Province:** Change, chaos
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Forge, Knowledge, Trickery
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Paladins are rarely champions of the Traveler, though any oath's mechanical features could be used to pursue a life of change.

The Traveler touches the domains of many other Sovereigns. Like Aureon and the Shadow, the Traveler is a source of knowledge. Along with Olladra and the Mockery, it is a patron of those who rely on deception and cunning. Like Onatar and the Fury, it can provide inspiration to the artisan. Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere it agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it's because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you have known. If it helps you deceive, it's because your actions will introduce chaos and crisis--whether into your life or the lives of others. Onatar will teach a swordsmith to make a better sword; the Traveler might show them how to make a bomb, changing the face of warfare. The Traveler isn't here to satisfy your greed or to grant your ambitions. Instead, it will set you on paths you never thought to try. This may sometimes grant you good fortune, but when you call on the Traveler, you're inviting the unexpected into your life.

One of the more infamous Traveler cults within the Five Nations is hidden within House Cannith. While Onatar is the acknowledged patron of House Cannith, some believe that the Traveler is the source of dramatic inspiration, helping artificers make unforeseen breakthroughs. Those who invoke the Traveler know that its gifts will surely have a cost and could shake the foundations of civilization, but they still yearn for that grand discovery. Many in House Cannith believe that Aaren d'Cannith--the inventor of the warforged--was a Traveler cultist; others assume that the Mourning may have been the work of a Cannith heir following the path of the Traveler.

Some who follow the Traveler are tricksters, causing chaos with no clear agenda. But others see themselves as guides, playing tricks on people in order to teach them lessons. Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions--not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven't outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers described in chapter 2 fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them. Ultimately, the Traveler will throw your life into chaos--for it's by adapting to this chaos that people grow.

## The Cults of the Dragon Below

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/66%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

The title "Cult of the Dragon Below" is a blanket term used to describe any sect that serves a malevolent power or has bizarre beliefs that defy rational thought. But no member of such an organization would call themselves a "cultist of the Dragon Below." As a true believer, you might be a blessed eye of the All-Seer, a pilgrim on the road to the Inner Sun, or a warlock in the court of the Queen of Shadows. If you're a member of one of these three cults, you don't see the other two as allies, for they're clearly dangerous and delusional. And while outsiders may be able to guess what force is behind the cult--it doesn't take a Korranberg sage to guess that the people growing eyes on their hands might be tied to Belashyrra--only a fraction of the cults of the Dragon Below knowingly serve a daelkyr or overlord.

Cults of the Dragon Below are categorized by two elements: structure and power. The structure defines the shape and scale of a cult, while the power is the malevolent force behind it, usually a daelkyr or fiendish overlord. The Cults of the Dragon Below table provides a few examples of cults--simply scratching the surface of what can appear in the world--and the rest of the section explores these elements in more detail.

### Cult Structure

**Rak Tulkhesh** has tribes of barbarians clamoring to spill blood in his name in the Demon Wastes. He has loyalists in the Five Nations subtly spreading hatred and ignorance. And he produces revenants, innocents who wake up convinced they are reincarnated soldiers with a duty to complete unfinished battles. This is common--most overlords and daelkyr have multiple cults, each completely unaware of another. While each cult is unique, most fall into one of the following three categories.

#### Corrupted

Members of these cults are united by shared delusions, the reality of their minds corrupted by a horrifying alien force. Sometimes the delusion infects those who take part in the rituals; other times the ideas first leak into people's minds, then draw them to the cult. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below can never be wiped out, and why they can appear anywhere--you never know when or where an irrational idea can take root, twisting the thoughts and beliefs of innocent people.

While a corrupted cult's beliefs and actions may seem irrational to outsiders, to members of the cult they make perfect sense. A revenant truly believes they are a legendary hero reincarnated. A Vigilant Eye cultist believes they've been given blessed vision that reveals evildoers who must die. The fact the cultist has grown a new eye doesn't seem strange to them--*it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.* Corrupted cultists may see the world differently than people around them. A group of revenants could be working with a mind flayer and dolgrims, but they see these aberrations as loyal knights tied to their ancient order. When encountering a corrupted cult, player characters will face the challenge of making sense of the delusion--understanding what the cult members believe they're trying to accomplish, and how it relates to what they're actually doing. These delusions have nothing to do with mental illness and cannot be treated at a Jorasco healing house. This is a form of supernatural influence with a specific cause--a corrupting alien entity--and with a specific effect; corruption can take hold of anyone at any time, and cultists may otherwise appear perfectly healthy and sane.

Corrupted cults rarely last long. They typically come into existence with a clear purpose, a specific scheme that somehow benefits their guiding power. After this scheme succeeds or fails, the driving force often abandons the survivors. The question is whether this releases cultists from the delusion, or whether they are simply abandoned--or even driven toward destructive acts. A second important question is whether it's possible to free a cultist from their delusion while the cult is still active. This could require magic, such as *greater restoration*. But it could simply require the cultist to be isolated from their allies and deprogrammed, or perhaps separated from an item that is reinforcing the delusion. If this powerful delusion can be broken, perhaps the cultist's original identity can reassert itself.

The power behind a corrupted cult isn't always obvious. Loyalists know the power they serve and often proudly proclaim it, but many other corrupted cults aren't aware of the power behind them. Vigilant Eye cultists could mistakenly believe that their blessed eyes are a gift from Aureon, while a revenant might believe Dol Arrah has returned them to the world. Even if the cultists themselves don't realize who they serve, the trappings can be a giveaway. Belashyrra's cultists often deal with eyes or beholders, Dyrrn employs illithids and doppelgangers, and Kyrzin's cults usually have something to do with oozes and slime. But sometimes a cult can appear perfectly innocent. Are you absolutely certain that revenant *wasn't* restored by Dol Arrah?

#### Traditional

There are cults far older than any human civilization. Their strongholds are in desolate regions--the Demon Wastes, the Shadow Marches--but immigrants have carried these beliefs into the Five Nations. The members of these cults have been raised to believe that the traditions of their faith are normal. *You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.*

Traditional cultists are typically less volatile and extreme than corrupted cultists; surviving long enough to become a tradition means avoiding reckless behavior and learning to keep your faith hidden from strangers. Many traditional cults can seem harmless; for the most part, Whisperers have no interest in harming or interacting with outsiders. However, traditional cults provide a lurking support network that can be activated when needed. **Rak Tulkhesh** has loyalists hidden throughout the armies of the Five Nations, always ready to escalate violent situations. And a town could be filled with followers of the Transcendent Flesh who appear completely harmless and mundane--until the Night of Six Moons, when they all attach their symbionts and tear apart any outsiders unlucky enough to be in the town that night.

Traditional cults are less extreme than corrupted ones, but they still see the world through a strange lens, despite knowing the power they're bound to. Some traditional cults believe their patrons are simply misunderstood--*Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!* Others celebrate the destructive or chaotic aspects of their patrons, either believing that this corrupt world deserves to be torn down, or that the faithful will be elevated in the next age. Even a cultist who reveres **Rak Tulkhesh** may not be evil; they could believe the corrupt world must be washed in blood to cleanse evil, and aside from their duties to the Orphan King, they may be gentle and altruistic.

#### Transactional

The dark powers associated with the cults of the Dragon Below have much to offer. They can imbue their servants with mystical powers, following the model of the warlock. Daelkyr can provide symbionts and physical transformation, while the Lords of Dust can provide wealth, influence, or ancient artifacts to their loyal agents. As a result, transactional cults often begin as secret societies. People join of their own free will, eager to obtain whatever it is the cult has to offer. But even if someone joins for the most rational of reasons, the influence of a daelkyr or an overlord is difficult to resist; the longer someone remains in the cult, the more power it will have over them.

Consider the Court of Shadows cult, tied to **Sul Khatesh**. A wizard has a fascinating conversation with a colleague, discussing a spell unlike anything they've seen before. The colleague explains that the spell is from Ashtakala's vaults, and if the wizard joins the Court, they'll discover many amazing things about magic and history. So they go to a meeting and are impressed by the scholars and warlocks they meet. Soon they're initiated into the cult, swearing an oath to the Queen of Shadows and being invested as the Knight of the Forgotten Library. It seems like a game, and they're gaining access to fascinating new spells. But as time passes, they become ever more obsessed with rising in the Court of Shadows. The political interplay in the Kingdom of Shadows feels more real, more relevant than the mundane politics of Khorvaire. They pursue missions for the Queen, yearning to win her favor. And they hope that someday the Queen will rise from her slumber, for then, the Kingdom of Shadows will truly become real.

Transactional cults can be found anywhere on this slippery slope. A transactional cult might use symbiont weapons but otherwise be quite rational. Or, while you can still see how they stumbled into this mess, they could be completely pulled into the warped reality espoused by the cult.

Transactional cults are typically small, but can be widespread. A coven of the Court of Shadows may only have a few members, but the Court itself is spread across Khorvaire. Often, members of transactional cults know who they are dealing with, but greed or curiosity overrides concerns. However, it's also possible for people to only know part of the story; a warlock might believe that the Queen of Shadows is a mighty warlock or perhaps an archfey, not realizing she's actually an overlord.

### Cult Goals

What do the cults of the Dragon Below *want*? What do members strive to achieve? This varies based on the structure and patron of the cult. All of the malevolent powers described in this section have loyalists, cults that are devoted to releasing their lords from Khyber or helping their agents (be they Lords of Dust, mind flayers, or rogue dragons) with whatever they require. But beyond the loyalists, cult goals can be a little more exotic.

Corrupted cults usually have some sort of immediate goal that drives the formation and expansion of the cult. *The Vigilant Eye is hunting down "demons" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!* The goals are often terrible things that must be stopped, but it's not always obvious how they are helping the power behind the cult; these schemes may have nothing to do with the seals of the daelkyr or releasing an overlord. In the case of an overlord, the archfiends gain strength by driving mortals down their paths. For **Sul Khatesh**, getting mortals to use magic for malevolence strengthens her regardless of what they actually do; likewise, **Rak Tulkhesh** revels in all violence. Meanwhile, the daelkyr are truly incomprehensible. They certainly enjoy experimenting with their preferred mediums; one of **Dyrrn's** cults could enact a ritual that causes dragonmarks to come to life and attack their bearers, with no purpose beyond satisfying Dyrrn's curiosity. As the daelkyr experience time in a nonlinear fashion, it's also possible that what seems like meaningless chaos could have a unforeseen future--that there will come a time when a living dragonmark unleashed in the cult's bizarre rampage ends up being the vital element needed to defeat one of the Lords of Dust. The key point is that cults of the Dragon Below--particularly corrupted cults--may not have long-term plans; their schemes can and should often appear nonsensical.

Traditional cults are religions. They aren't driven by short term goals, but instead provide guidelines on how to live your whole life. Traditional cults can be peaceful and innocuous... until they aren't. A particular alignment of moons, a vision sent to the cult leader, a critical mass of outsiders arriving at the same time--any cult could have a set of circumstances that trigger bloody rituals or brutal sacrifices. This is where the absurdity of a traditional cult rises to the surface. The people of Lowholt couldn't be kinder--until the flesh barn runs low on spleen and they have to harvest your organs. *It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen*--the "grandparents" in this case being the gibbering mouther in the basement.

Transactional cults are often initially driven by the desires of the members. Someone joins a transactional cult because they want the power to do something--to take revenge on their enemies, to overthrow a tyrant, to destroy a local criminal gang. But the patron always has a price, and this can eventually follow the same model described for corrupted cults earlier.

### The Powers Behind the Cults

Each cult of the Dragon Below is tied to a sinister power trapped in Khyber, and a cult's goals usually reflect the power behind it. If the cult has inhuman allies, are they fiends, aberrations, or other monsters? What sort of treasures and magic items does the group use? These magic items aren't necessarily direct gifts from the patron; a cult of Kyrzin may have many potions because the high priest is an alchemist, or because a strange fountain in the temple secretes mystical fluids. In the case of loyalists and traditional cults, the connection to its patron may be quite obvious, whereas corrupted cults can be challenging to identify the hidden manipulator. Regardless of whether cultists know the identity of their patron, the power behind a cult has many effects.

As a broad rule, cults tied to overlords (Rak Tulkhesh, Sul Khatesh, Katashka, Bel Shalor, the Daughter of Khyber) are either directly helping the Lords of Dust or trying to drive behavior that strengthens the archfiend. The daelkyr (Belashyrra, Dyrrn, Kyrzin, Orlaask, Valaara) are more enigmatic. Their traditional cults may continue strange patterns of behavior handed down for generations, performing sacrifices or mysterious rituals when the planes are aligned. But they can also engage in dramatic actions with no clear benefit to anyone. There's no clear reason for Orlassk to turn citizens of Sharn into gargoyles; it could be an experiment, or simply a form of art. But these actions will be related to the sphere of the daelkyr that causes it, whether that's oozes, stone, eyes, or insects.

The ten powers described below reflect the most common cults, but there are many other overlords and daelkyr. There will never be a complete list, and DMs can always develop new powers. Use these as inspiration, but don't feel limited.

#### Bel Shalor: The Shadow in the Flame

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/68%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>The brightest soul casts the longest shadow. You can't escape the evil within you. It's always one step behind, waiting for you to miss a step. Even if you keep your footing, do you truly believe that those around you are as strong as you? Are they so virtuous? Or have they already let the darkness in?
>>

The overlords embody mortal fears, and Bel Shalor embodies our fear of *other mortals*--the eternal suspicion that a stranger means us harm, that even our friends can't be trusted. Bel Shalor thrives on paranoia and feasts when fear drives good people to do terrible things. Wars feed Rak Tulkhesh, but an inquisition that torments countless innocents delights Bel Shalor--especially when carried out by virtuous people. In the third century YK, Bel Shalor nearly escaped his bonds before being bound once more by the sacrifice of Tira Miron, but some sages wonder if Bel Shalor didn't in fact *allow* himself to be defeated. Now he is forever tied to Tira, and anyone who can hear the Voice of the Silver Flame can also hear the tempting whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.

Bel Shalor doesn't encourage savage violence. Instead, he amplifies fears and suspicions while fanning the fires of greed and self-interest. He convinces us that the people around us are cruel and petty; the only way to survive is to strike first, to take what we need regardless of the cost to others.

Corrupted cults can appear anywhere; Bel Shalor seizes on a suspicion and amplifies it. The Whispering Flame is a transactional cult hidden within the Church of the Silver Flame--a secret order of priests and templars who do Bel Shalor's bidding in exchange for power and influence. The greatest agents of the Whispering Flame rarely perform obvious acts of corruption themselves; instead, they subtly encourage others to compromise their principles or succumb to their fears.

***Forces.*** Bel Shalor's chief agents are **rakshasa**, and his *prakhutu* ("speaker") on the Council of Ashtakala is known as the Wyrmbreaker. His minions specialize in stealth and deception, not brute force. Bel Shalor also controls shadows, and it's said he can grant malevolent life to anyone's shadow, causing it to spy on the person who casts it or even to kill them.

***Gifts.*** Magic items associated with Bel Shalor typically are used to manipulate others, conceal thoughts, or control shadows. Important members of the Whispering Flame often receive a *ring of mind shielding*, and may use *eyes of charming* to influence others. Such items are typically made by the Lords of Dust, though they can be ancient relics or items infused with the power of the Shadow in the Flame.

***Character Ideas.*** Bel Shalor thrives on manipulating thoughts and emotions. A bard of the College of Whispers could attribute their gifts and magical talents--the ability to harness fears and even steal another's shadow--to a bond to Bel Shalor. For a warlock, either the Archfey or the Great Old One could represent the Shadow in the Flame. Members of the Whispering Flame sometimes begin as paladins or clerics devoted to the Silver Flame. Even once serving Bel Shalor, they are able to retain a connection to the Flame and keep their class abilities; however, they typically shift to the Trickery domain or the Oathbreaker oath.

***Story Ideas.*** Any fear could be amplified by Bel Shalor and form the basis of a cult. A group of people in a small town might become convinced that there's a **doppelganger** or a **wererat** hidden in the community that has to be rooted out at any cost. Or perhaps it's a fear of foreign spies. Or warforged made to replace humans... can you prove that you're not a warforged imposter? Frequently such cults truly believe that they're protecting the innocent from a serious threat, and don't realize that they are the ones serving a dark power.

Similar stories can be associated with the Whispering Flame. Cultists work to trick truly virtuous members of the church, convincing good templars to persecute innocent people in pursuit of imaginary threats. This situation--good people harming good people--delights Bel Shalor. Can adventurers expose the true agents of evil without killing innocents themselves?

#### Belashyrra: The Lord of Eyes

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/69-1%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>We know the world through our eyes. But sight is a gift of the Glorious Eye, and what is given can be taken away. Those who serve the All-Seer well are given new eyes, able to see layers of reality hidden from mere mortals. If only you could see what I can see!
>>

The daelkyr **Belashyrra** is associated with sight, and might use its cultists as vessels through which to explore the world. Belashyrra's cultists can become obsessed with sight, both unable to believe what they can't see, and utterly convinced of those things they can. They might experience visions others can't see, or gain powers linked with sight, like a beholder's eye rays. The concept of seeing secret things is critical for these cults and typically drives their missions. It's common for devoted cultists of Belashyrra to grow new eyes, as with the Vigilant Eye cult.

Belashyrra has traditional cults in the Shadow Marches; members generally keep to themselves, unless guided by visions or gathering sacrifices. Belashyrra's corrupted cults can appear anywhere, driven by ecstatic visions or convinced that only they can see threats that must be dealt with (such as members of the Vigilant Eye believing they can see hidden demons). Belashyrra's cultists aren't always dangerous; they can be gifted oracles, and sometimes they truly can see threats hidden from others. Belashyrra is also known to be fighting the Umbragen drow beneath Xen'drik.

***Forces.*** Belashyrra is the source of beholderkin in Eberron, though they can be found serving other daelkyr or operating independently. Any aberration whose powers revolve around eyes or vision could be tied to Belashyrra. Any creature created by Belashyrra will have extra eyes; this includes its **dolgaunts** and **dolgrims**, though the dolgaunts still possess blindsight.

***Gifts.*** Any magic item associated with sight can be tied to Belashyrra, usually in symbiont form. Cultists may have organic versions of *eyes of the eagle*, *eyes of charming*, or *goggles of night*; a *robe of eyes* could be made from a leathery material that bonds to the wearer's body. Symbiont items that grant sight-related abilities will often demand to see certain things; the wearer will simply have a sense that the robe wants to see what's inside that building, and refusing such requests could result in losing the powers of the item until a long or short rest has been completed. In addition to items, Belashyrra can grant supernatural gifts tied to sight, such as granting darkvision or the ability to use *true seeing* once a week; such gifts usually take the form of a new eye manifesting on the victim, with the power only working through that eye.

***Character Ideas.*** Belashyrra can be an excellent patron for a Great Old One warlock, because typically what it asks of its warlocks is to see things; a warlock will be charged to find something or observe a particular event. Sight-related invocations are common, and spell effects may be channeled through the eyes--either the warlock's natural eyes, or new ones that they manifest. Any character could be guided by visions shown by Belashyrra; a paladin might not follow a god, but rather be driven by the visions of evil Belashyrra shows them. Is Belashyrra guiding them to stop evil, or is the All-Seer mocking them by showing them the evil people do, while the paladin is determined to prevent these visions from coming to pass?

***Story Ideas.*** Due to a cult's actions, people start seeing hidden truths they don't want to know. A wave of visual hallucinations is causing people to see their friends as monsters or deadly enemies. A serial killer is collecting eyes of different species to offer to the All-Seer. A loyalist cult sees signs that reveal one of the adventurers is their next designated sacrifice. An individual or group (such as the Vigilant Eye) is guided by visions leading them to murder hidden demons--are they killing innocents, or could there truly be demons hidden in the community?

#### The Daughter of Khyber

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/69-2%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>Even Eberron herself couldn't defeat Khyber, and the day is coming when she'll break her chains, shattering the world that you know, revealing the one that was always meant to be. Khyber's Daughter gathers her armies, and soon their wings will blot out the sun.
>>

The Daughter of Khyber embodies the fear of dragons. She manipulates the hearts and minds of dragons, turning them to darkness and ultimately seizing control. This has kept the dragons in self-imposed isolation in Argonnessen; the more they exert their power, the stronger Khyber's Daughter becomes.

Of all the cults, this is the one that most truly serves the Dragon Below. Loyalists serve the Daughter of Khyber as the greatest champion of her mother and the harbinger of Khyber's return. Loyalist doctrine maintains that Khyber didn't betray Siberys; instead, she was the one betrayed. Khyber had a grand and glorious vision for reality, but the other Progenitors turned on her. Cultists typically see themselves as being oppressed by laws and systems; like Khyber, they are imprisoned by their inferiors, by people who don't understand their vision for the world, and they will ascend to glory when Khyber rises. Some cults maintain that dragons themselves were the creations of Khyber and were stolen by Siberys and Eberron; under this belief, the Daughter isn't corrupting dragons, but rather restoring them to their rightful role. In any case, loyalists see themselves as warriors in a battle to restore proper balance to reality, heroes who will be elevated in the dark and beautiful reality soon to be revealed through dragonfire and blood.

Corrupted cultists may share these beliefs. Other common delusions include the idea that cultists are dragons--either transformed and trapped in human form, or inheritors of draconic bloodlines who could someday regain their proper form. In extreme cases, such cultists may manifest draconic physical traits--growing scales or claws, manifesting breath weapons, or wielding sorcerous power.

Some cults refer to the Daughter of Khyber as Tiamat, after the draconic deity known in other sections of the multiverse. However, the Daughter of Khyber is a fiendish overlord, bound in the Pit of Five Sorrows in Argonnessen, and does not wield power in other realms.

***Forces.*** The Daughter of Khyber is associated with dragons, along with dragonborn, **kobolds**, and other creatures with draconic traits. While she has rakshasa followers among the Lords of Dust, her primary servants are abishai.

***Gifts.*** Magic items associated with the Daughter of Khyber are usually associated with dragons in some way, and may come from Argonnessen or be relics from the Age of Demons. Magic weapons and armor may be made from dragon scales or bones. Artifacts and wondrous items that allow the bearer to control dragons, protect them from dragons, or emulate draconic abilities are all possible.

***Character Ideas.*** The powers of a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer could be tied to the Daughter of Khyber; was it you that forged this bond, or did one of your ancestors serve the Dragon Below? A dragonborn character could have been born as another species, transformed into their current form by the Daughter of Khyber. A cultist barbarian could be described as taking on draconic traits when they rage, their damage resistance granted by rage reflecting a temporary layer of dragon scales.

***Story Ideas.*** The residents of a small village have been transforming into dragonborn, hearing the whispering voice of the Daughter calling them to service. Can this be stopped and the victims restored? A group of cultists are convinced they are dragons, and seek to spread a message of draconic dominance. A scholar obsessed with the Draconic Prophecy is secretly a servant of Khyber's Daughter... and possibly even a corrupted dragon. A young dragon dominated by the Daughter of Khyber is raiding villages--but what purpose does this serve? A dragon tied to the Chamber employs adventurers to recover an *Orb of Dragonkind*--will the party surrender it once it's in their hands?

#### Dyrrn: The Corrupter

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/70%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>Flesh isn't final: it's clay to be molded into something better. We can be so much more than these bodies we're born with. You were birthed in the prison of everyday life, but there are paths in this foul labyrinth that lead to unimaginable wonders. Let us show you the way.
>>

One of the most active daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is infamous for warping mind and body to turn innocents into monsters. It's said that Dyrrn bred the first **dolgrims** and **dolgaunts** from goblinoid stock. It created **doppelgangers** from changelings, and perhaps even **chokers** from halflings. Strong evidence suggests Dyrrn corrupted shifters, creating the first lycanthropes. Lord of the mind flayers, it takes equal joy in twisting thoughts and flesh.

Dyrrn's loyalists believe that the Corruptor will ultimately consume and transform the world, and that only those who serve it will survive the experience. However, there are other cults--such as the Transcendent Flesh--who see Dyrrn's actions in a positive light. Dyrrn transforms and creates new forms of life--but who are we to decide that these things are monsters? Such cultists believe that Dyrrn is driving evolution, and they can transcend their own limits by walking the path of the Foul Labyrinth. While this can start as simply transactional, the influence of the Corruptor is insidious, and cultists can soon start to see natural creatures as vile and weak.

Dyrrn has had a long presence in western Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, and the Wardens of the Wood remain ever watchful for its vile creations. During the Last War, the dwarves of the Mror Holds discovered that Dyrrn's forces were deeply entrenched in the ancient realm below their holdings. While many clans are determined to drive all aberrations from the depths, others feel it may be possible to use Dyrrn's power for the greater good; this has offered a foothold for the Transcendent Flesh and other cults to spread.

***Forces.*** Dyrrn has created many of the aberrations used by all daelkyr, such as **dolgaunts** and **dolgrims**. It's the source of **mind flayers** in Eberron; they know Dyrrn as the Overmind, and it serves as the cornerstone of their collective consciousness. **Doppelgangers** and **mind flayers** are often associated with Dyrrn's cults, but any aberration or monstrosity could appear.

***Gifts.*** Dyrrn is a prolific producer of symbionts. It's not bound to any one theme; any living weapon or tool could be tied to Dyrrn. It's also closely associated with psionic powers and the evolution of the mind, and a cult could be found wielding tools that focus mental power.

***Character Ideas.*** An artificer could hear Dyrrn's whispers, guiding them to create living tools; their infusions might appear to be alive, though their effects are the same as those for other artificers. A warlock bound to Dyrrn could experience dramatic physical transformation or focus on powers that control thought--are they now a renegade fighting Dyrrn, or being guided toward evolution? A barbarian could present their rage as a disturbing physical transformation, while a transmuter wizard might follow in Mordain the Fleshweaver's footsteps.

***Story Ideas.*** Dyrrn's cults can always provide a foothold for aberrations to enter a story. Cultists could be creating monsters from corpses, cloning important people and releasing the clones into the world, or turning innocent people into aberrations. A Transcendent Flesh cult might focus on their own physical or mental evolution and have no intention of harming others--until they need extra brains or body parts. Someone might discover that Dyrrn is responsible for both aberrant and true dragonmarks; what impact would this have on the world?

#### Katashka: The Gatekeepr

>>You cannot defeat me. You fear death, knowing your flesh will rot and your soul will shrivel away in Dolurrh. But I serve the Grim King, the Keeper of the Gate--and even if you kill me now, he will open the gate for my return.
>>

The overlord Katashka embodies the fears of both death and the undead. People often assume that the followers of the Blood of Vol want to become undead, but it is Katashka's cultists who embrace this dark destiny. His loyalists dream of a world where the dead reign over the living, reveling in the power death holds over the rabble, secure in the belief that Katashka will either grant them immortality through undeath or raise them when they fall.

Katashka thrives both on the fear of death and fear of the undead. As such, his cults might spread plagues or otherwise cause mass death, or they might unleash ghouls in the sewers or trigger zombie outbreaks. His intent is not death itself--the Grim King draws strength from the *fear* of the living. As such, Katashka rarely seeks to kill people swiftly. The primary purpose of the lingering plague is to sow fear among those fighting it, and the small pack of ghouls that causes long-term terror is more effective than an army that wipes out a city in a day. Likewise, Katashka's undead champions revel in their unnatural condition; they want people to know what they are and to fear them.

The Gatekeeper's cults are often transactional, with cultists serving the Grim King in exchange for secrets of necromancy or undead servants. Corrupted cults will in some way tie to death or the undead; Katashka also produces revenants. Katashka's cults have no established territories, but are actually rarer in Karrnath than elsewhere in the Five Nations, as the Blood of Vol presents a different path to necromantic magic along with a more positive overall message for followers.

There are some obvious similarities between Katashka and the Keeper, and some scholars assert that they are one and the same--that Katashka's actions in the Age of Demons inspired the myths of the Keeper. A critical difference is Katashka's focus on undeath, in some ways resembling the role of Orcus in other settings. In contrast, priests of the Keeper also deal with general greed, offering deals that have nothing to do with death or undeath.

***Forces.*** Katashka's forces are undead; even within the Lords of Dust, his champions are liches, **death knights**, and dracoliches. His transactional cults include necromancers, though he actually has fewer necromancers in his service than are found among the Blood of Vol and the Emerald Claw; his followers don't need to understand the science of necromancy if their dark lord raises bones for them.

***Gifts.*** Katashka's treasures are tools that consume life, such as a *sword of life stealing*. His cultists may also possess tools that create or command undead. Beyond this, the greatest gift Katashka grants his followers is life after death. A champion of Katashka could be repeatedly raised after death, forcing adventurers to find more elaborate ways to prevent their resurrection. His champions could also be returned as undead; only valuable servants are granted a second life as liches or vampires, but lesser cultists could rise after death as zombies or ghouls--an unpleasant surprise for adventurers fighting them!

***Character Ideas.*** A Zealot barbarian dealing necrotic damage could have a tie to the Grim King; do they have to earn this power by killing in the name of the Gatekeeper? The Undying warlock patron is another sound match for Katashka. While the Death domain and the Oathbreaker paladin both fit Katashka thematically, Katashka isn't a god and such characters may be a better fit for the Keeper or the Blood of Vol. Perhaps you died in the past, then were returned to life by Katashka, but with a bargain to fulfill--along with the knowledge that if you fail to carry out your mission, you will die again. Will you do the bidding of the Grim King, or will you try to find another way to earn your life?

***Story Ideas.*** Any plotline involving evil undead or power-hungry necromancers can be laid at Katashka's feet; his cults require less nuance than the Blood of Vol. A common theme is the fact that Katashka doesn't simply want to kill innocents, he wants people to fear death and the undead.

#### Kyrzin: The Prince of Slime

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/71-2%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>Slime, water, blood--fluids are the purest essence of life. We begin as a drop of liquid, and in the end we return to it. Drink the bounty of the Bile Lord. Heed the voice of the Lurker Within, for it's already part of you. Follow our teachings, and after death, you'll find eternal peace in the whispering choir.
>>

The daelkyr Kyrzin deals in living liquids and foul fluids. It is infamous as the source of all oozes; some believe that there are living rivers of gray ooze and green slime in the depths of Khyber. Many cults revere gibbering mouthers and hear guiding words in the ravings of these beasts; such cults refer to Kyrzin as the Regent of Whispers. While oozes play a major role, its cults can be associated with liquid in any form. One cult might venerate an ancient well, while others say that the local lake holds the ghosts of their ancestors. Any delusion associated with liquids could be tied to Kyrzin.

Kyrzin's traditional cults are strongly established in the Shadow Marches, but Whisperers keep to themselves. Marchers refer to the common cold as "the drip" or the "Bile Lord's kiss;" and stories say that Kyrzin has sown giant oozes in the rivers of the Marches. While many Marchers know stories of the Prince of Slime, it's typically seen as a dangerous but largely neutral force. Mold plays an important part in Marcher medicine, and the Bile Lord is seen as a force that can cause disease when angered, or help to prevent it. So most prefer to ignore and avoid Kyrzin, and Whisperers are largely left alone.

***Forces.*** In Eberron, Kyrzin replaces Juiblex as the source of **black puddings**, **gray oozes**, **gibbering mouthers**, **mimics**, and similar creatures, any of which could be tied to the Prince of Slime. It can also create creatures similar to living spells, though Kyrzin is not responsible for the living spells that roam the Mournland. Its most infamous creations are parasitic oozes, a form of black pudding that can enter a creature's body. More intelligent than their larger kin, these oozes can communicate telepathically with their hosts. An adventurer who kills a weak cultist may have an unpleasant surprise when a deadly parasitic ooze emerges from the corpse! Victims unwillingly bonded to a parasitic slime must find a way to coexist until they can be freed from the creature (*greater restoration* will expel it). If angered, the ooze can eat its way out of the victim, which is usually fatal. Kyrzin is also served by **dolgaunts** and **dolgrims**; those created by the Prince of Slime have slimy, translucent skin.

***Gifts.*** Kyrzin's cults are well stocked with potions. While they may have standard effects, Kyrzin's potions are often disturbing to look at and may crawl about, ooze-like, if spilled. Kyrzin's symbionts often mimic the effects of magical garments, though they are fluid rather than fabric; Kyrzin's *cloak of elvenkind* is an amorphous shroud that shifts to match its surroundings.

***Character Ideas.*** An artificer from an old Whisperer family could have an unorthodox approach to alchemy, and their homunculus could be a living ooze. A Great Old One warlock could specialize in spells dealing with fluids or confusing whispers; even *eldritch blast* could be flavored as flinging globs of mystically charged slime.

***Story Ideas.*** A cult could do something unusual to the water supply of a town, whether introducing poisons or hallucinogens, or transforming the water into living ooze. Kyrzin's parasitic oozes could spread throughout a town or take over a particular organization--but what do they actually want? Friends of the party could be consumed by a gibbering mouther--but could they still be alive within the slime?

#### Orlassk: The Voice in the Stone

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/72-1%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>Stone is immortal. It listens. It remembers. It chooses to be still, but anyone who's seen a gargoyle knows it can move whenever it chooses. So respect the stone, for it'll still be here long after you've turned to dust.
>>

The daelkyr Orlassk is the master of stone. Orlassk's traditional cults say that it is the Still Lord who carves out caverns, and that it is the Voice in the Stone that guides the miner to the ore. Orlassk can breathe life into stone, as seen in the **gargoyle**; but it can also turn living creatures into stone, and it's thought that most creatures with this power--**medusas**, **gorgons**, **basilisks**, **cockatrices**--are its creations. Cults may associate with such creatures, but they can also venerate stone itself. Orlassk's cultists could venerate a sacred stone that whispers when it's fed fresh blood, or maintain a deep chamber where all the secret knowledge of the cult is engraved into the walls.

Orlassk is one of the lesser known daelkyr. Its cults are found where people live around stone, in high mountains and deep caves. Orlassk's corrupted cults often form around those who work with stone: masons, sculptors, stone giants, or even just people who dwell in stone towers. When the walls start whispering to you, Orlassk has found you.

Orlassk is thought to have feuds with other daelkyr. Orlassk and Kyrzin are fundamentally opposed: solid against liquid, static against change. Some scholars suggest that Orlassk's creation of **medusas** and **basilisks** is a blow against **Belashyrra**, as seeing these creatures is what triggers their deadly power.

***Forces.*** Orlassk is tied to creatures of stone, both those made of stone and those that petrify. The **medusas** of Cazhaak Draal in Droaam deny any connection to Orlassk, but it may have **medusa** cultists elsewhere in Khyber. Orlassk has many **gargoyle** servants in exotic variations. It employs creatively twisted earth elementals. Orlassk's **dolgrim** and **dolgaunt** minions have a rocky skin texture and can stand still indefinitely.

***Gifts.*** Any form of magic item that is related to stone can be associated with Orlassk. Cultists often use *figurines of wondrous power*, though the beasts associated with them are usually aberrant and strange. Orlassk is the most common source of *Ioun stones* in Eberron, its stones whispering disturbing secrets to the attuned character. Orlassk's cults may also employ armor or weapons made out of enchanted stone instead of metal.

***Character Ideas.*** A Totem Warrior barbarian could describe the benefits of the Bear Totem as the Still Lord's blessing, with their skin taking on a stone-like texture during their rage. A Battle Smith artificer could work with stone instead of metal, sculpting their **Steel Defender** before bringing it to life.

***Story Ideas.*** All of the statues in a city begin speaking, whispering dangerous secrets. There's a series of inexplicable murders; could it be the work of statues coming to life? A corrupted cult is drawing in members who are then petrified. Their cult leader says that a terrible cataclysm is about to occur, and only those petrified will survive, and the Still Lord will free them once it passes; could it be true? The rituals of a cult are slowly turning a community and everyone in it into stone. A cult is sculpting statues that then come to life; are they replacing important people with these duplicates, or working on a monster that could destroy the city? The cult's rituals are drawing **gargoyles** to the city, but for what purpose?

#### Rak Tulkesh: The Rage of War

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/72-2%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>It is only in conflict that we find ourselves. We can only know our strength when we measure it against another. Laws are traps laid by the weak to control the stronger; anything you can take with fist or blade is yours by right.
>>

The overlord **Rak Tulkhesh** embodies the fear of war and bloodshed, whether as a victim of violence or losing oneself to bloodlust and rage. The cults of Rak Tulkhesh include brutal raiders who embrace lives of endless violence, but it also includes those who spread hate and strife--anything that could stir up harsh conflict where there might otherwise be peace.

While most of the Orphan King's cults are driven by ruthless aggression, they could also believe they are serving a greater good. A corrupted cult might truly be determined to bring down bandits that are preying on innocents; they are simply driven by the delusion that there are no other alternatives to bloodshed. Another common delusion is that the current world must be cleansed in bloody battle to clear the path for a peaceful world--these cultists are only fighting today so that their children may know peace tomorrow.

The Rage of War has a particularly strong following among the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, but he has drawn strength from the Last War and cults can be found anywhere in the Five Nations, especially in communities that suffered serious losses during the war. Just as Katashka differs from the Keeper, Rak Tulkhesh is different from the Three Faces of War. Rak Tulkhesh isn't a god of war who guides the hands of each soldier; rather, he drives aggression and revels in the bloodshed, regardless of who wins or loses.

***Forces.*** The Rage of War has fiendish servants among the Lords of Dust, including **rakshasa**, **narzugons**, **merregons**, and other devils and demons. But Rak Tulkhesh's forces are primarily mortal. In addition to the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, many of the **minotaurs** of Droaam revere Rak Tulkhesh in the guise of the Horned Prince. The Znir Pact **gnolls** have broken ties with fiends, but there are still many gnolls--especially in the Demon Wastes--bound to the Rage of War.

***Gifts.*** Rak Tulkhesh arms his champions with magical weapons. The most powerful might be forged in Ashtakala or relics of the Age of Demons, but on a lesser level, Rak Tulkhesh's cults have an uncanny talent for finding arms dealers and securing the best weapons available within a particular region.

***Character Ideas.*** The barbarian is the iconic champion of Rak Tulkhesh, and as a cultist, you could be a proud minotaur dedicating your kills to the Horned Prince, or a human or tiefling from the Demon Wastes who's left your treacherous land behind. The Hexblade warlock is a possible path for a cultist bound to Rak Tulkhesh; your weapon could be an artifact from the Age of Demons, forged by Mordakhesh the Shadowsword. Do you revel in your powers, or is your blade a curse? Perhaps it will take a life once a week, and if you don't kill someone who deserves it, you know the blade will kill an innocent.

***Story Ideas.*** Like Bel Shalor, plots tied to Rak Tulkhesh can focus on escalating tensions in the aftermath of the Last War; the primary difference is that Bel Shalor's cultists may promote more nuanced inquisitions, while Rak Tulkhesh will inspire mob violence. Locals could unleash their rage on Cyran refugees or warforged, believing they threaten their livelihoods. Revenants could claim to be the spirits of heroes returned to right ancient wrongs. A charismatic leader could inspire a community to rise up against oppression--fighting bandits or a tyrannical local lord. It's a noble cause, but how many people will die in the violent uprising that follows?

#### Sul Khatesh: The Keeper of Secrets

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/73-1%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>I know the secrets that shape the world. With three words, I can kill with fire; with four, ice. But why should I, when I can bend you to my will? The Queen of Shadows reveals your secrets--do as I command, or all will learn what you've hidden.
>>

The overlord **Sul Khatesh** embodies the fear of both magic and of secrets... for what is magic but secret knowledge? She whispers insights to students at Arcanix and inspires evokers working on weapons of war. But she also encourages people to keep secrets, and then sets misery in motion when she reveals these secrets to those who would use them.

Sul Khatesh's cults often begin as transactional. Wizards or would-be warlocks invoke her with rituals, offering blood or service in exchange for power and knowledge. Sul Khatesh has no need of mortal souls, but a cultist might believe they have sworn their soul to her. What truly delights her is when magic is used for cruel purposes or in ways that cause people to fear it. While cultists may forge a bond for rational reasons, the more people that draw on her gifts, the more that corruption can creep in. Members of the Court of Shadows believe that they are part of a shadow kingdom that becomes more real with each day; some members even believe they can see its towers and spires overlapping the structures of the real world. Other cults may become obsessed with their own power, embracing the idea that those who can do magic are superior to those who cannot--that it is their right to prey on these mundane cattle. Given her love of secrets, the cults of Sul Khatesh are almost always hidden and subtle. While magic usually plays a role in her cults, she could certainly have one that deals purely with blackmail and the manipulation of secrets.

***Forces.*** Sul Khatesh's supernatural agents are primarily **rakshasa**, often with greater mystical power than their comrades. Her prakhutu Hektula is the librarian of Ashtakala and perhaps the most knowledgeable sage in existence. Beyond this, her primary agents are mortals she has lured into her service and gifted with arcane power.

***Gifts.*** Those who serve the Keeper of Secrets are usually well supplied with scrolls and magic books, and cults could be given wands or rods crafted in Ashtakala. As Sul Khatesh's primary gift is knowledge, she might instead lead her followers to a cache of Dhakaani treasure or other hidden troves. Sul Khatesh is well known for bargaining with warlocks, and she can grant lesser spellcasting abilities should she choose.

***Character Ideas.*** Sul Khatesh can be an excellent patron for a warlock. Her gifts are versatile; depending on the powers you seek from her, she could grant the features associated with the Archfey, Fiend, or Hexblade patrons. The primary question for such a warlock is whether you still serve her--whether you are seeking to rise in the Court of Shadows even as you go about your adventuring career--or whether you regret the bargain that you made and are trying to find a way out. Any spellcaster could have received a boon from Sul Khatesh even if they don't have the close bond of a warlock; did she teach you your first spell in your dreams, and are you afraid she'll return to call in this favor? Likewise, a character who wants to take the Magic Initiate feat could frame this as a sudden gift from Sul Khatesh--but what's the catch?

***Story Ideas.*** A cult of Sul Khatesh is an easy way to introduce an evil wizard or cabal of warlocks using their gifts to terrify and dominate a community. The Court of Shadows could fill this role, but it could also be used in a more subtle way; perhaps nobles of the Court assist the adventurers, and they are drawn into the politics and intrigues of this imaginary kingdom. A cult of Sul Khatesh could be at the center of a web of blackmail that's tearing a city apart. A player character or NPC could suddenly find that they know the worst secrets of everyone they meet... but are they sure all of these secrets are true? Or is Sul Khatesh feeding them just enough truth that they'll start believing these insights without question, even if it leads them down evil paths?

#### Valaara: The Crawling Queen

![Artist: Laura Hirsbrunner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/73-2%20laura%20hirsbrunner.png)

>>Individuality is a curse. Every day, it fills you with disappointment and doubt. But within the Hive, you will always know your place, always know your purpose. Join us. Forget your past. Forget your pain. And help us build a better world.
>>

The daelkyr Valaara works with insects and all manner of crawling vermin. Its children are all around us, listening in the walls and consuming our dead. While it creates new and deadly forms of insects and arachnids, Valaara also experiments with insect consciousness, spreading the mind of a humanoid across multiple bodies. Victims of Valaara's delusions may believe that they are insects transformed into human form, or that they are being controlled or consumed by parasites. Its most widespread cult calls itself the Hive; members of this sect surrender their individuality to serve the collective, with mammals acting as if they're insects. The question when dealing with the Hive is whether it's solely a delusion and the victims can be saved, or whether the cultists truly have been consumed from within by Valaara's children, and are simply wearing human shells.

Beyond the Hive, Valaara's cults invariably interact with insects in some way. Some believe they are receiving divine messages hidden in the buzzing of insects. Others cultivate massive hives of telepathic insects or create charnel pits as a breeding ground for maggots.

Valaara has no established domain, but its cults often spring up in the sewers and middens of major cities. It prospers in places where insects and humans both thrive. Despite their shared affinity for vermin, the Children of Winter druids despise Valaara and its cults; they seek to preserve the natural order, whereas Valaara's creations are anything but natural.

***Forces.*** Valaara created the **carrion crawlers**, and any sort of unnatural insect or crawling vermin could be attributed to the Crawling Queen. Valaara doesn't associate with dolgaunts or dolgrims. Its primary servitors are **thri-kreen**; it is constantly twisting and evolving them, and they may be slightly different each time they're encountered. Swarms, **spiders**, **scorpions**, and other similar creatures can be found with Valaara's cults. However, as with all the daelkyr, Valaara takes natural things and makes them unnatural. When using a relatively mundane insect as a base creature, consider what you can add to making it unnatural. This could be a mystical ability, but it could also be abnormal intelligence or a cosmetic detail--perhaps the insects of the swarm are bioluminescent, and the fluctuating patterns of their glowing carapaces has an almost hypnotic effect; when the creatures fly, the buzzing of their wings sounds like maniacal human laughter.

***Gifts.*** Valaara creates chitinous armor and living weapons. It creates symbionts that burrow into the flesh of the host; two of its gifts are the *throwing scarab* and the *spellburrow*, both presented in chapter 7.

***Character Ideas.*** A druid using the Circle of Spores could be reflavored, with their Halo of Spores presented as an aura of insects. A character might believe they are one of Valaara's children--an insect transformed into humanoid form, either as an experiment or as a scout sent out to gather information.

***Story Ideas.*** A plague of unnatural locusts is stripping the land; what is drawing the insects here? A sect of the Hive is spreading through a squalid part of town, but are they preying on innocents, or are new members joining of their own free will? An insect follows the adventurers, whispering their secrets; is it a single warped creature, or just one drone from a telepathic hive?

### Cultist Characters

Members of the cults of the Dragon Below aren't always evil, and cults aren't always pursuing malevolent ends. The previous section presents a host of ideas for player characters with ties to a particular cult. But what does it mean to be a barbarian drawing power from the Rage of War?

Ultimately, the question is: what do you want it to mean? Do you want to play a character who knowingly serves a sinister power? Do you want to highlight the idea that while others see the power you deal with as evil, you interact with it in a positive way? Or do you want to explore the idea that you're either actively working to break your ties to the cult, or that you're a renegade fighting the power you once served? The Cultist Origins table provides examples you can use as inspiration.

## Unusual Faith

There are sources of divine magic that are concrete and clear--the Silver Flame is a pool of energy that binds the overlords, and spellcasters can divert its power for other purposes. There are other sources that are less certain--are the Sovereigns the deities their followers believe them to be, or is the power of a Sovereign cleric simply drawn from the power of collective belief? And then there's a third kind of source, where divine spellcasters draw power from devotion to forces that clearly are not divine and have no obvious way to grant such power. How is it that a warforged paladin can draw power from their devotion to the Lord of Blades when the Lord of Blades doesn't wield such power himself? Is a cleric of the Dragon Below actually receiving their power from a daelkyr, and if so, how?

Ultimately, these questions don't need an absolute answer; after all, the most basic principle of divine magic is that it's not scientific and can't be absolutely explained. But here are a few ways to approach such spellcasters.

### Borrowed Power

The most common theory advanced by theologists in Eberron is that people with exotic or implausible beliefs who wield divine magic are actually drawing that power from another source without realizing it--that their faith is so strong that an actual existing power answers the prayer. Phthaso Mogan of Sharn has written a treatise in which he describes a man who performed miracles based on his fanatical devotion to his own shoe. Mogan concluded that the man was actually receiving his power from Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Travel. But while it's possible to draw spells from worshiping a shoe, this would be extremely rare. Though the cause is debated, scholars recognize that the more similar your target of worship is to an archetypal Sovereign, the more likely you are to be granted divine magic. And thus, over the ages, civilizations have gravitated toward worshiping a variation of the Sovereign Host.

Mogan also proposed that clerics of unusual faiths may actually receive their spells from the Traveler, who might support such ideas to cause chaos and undermine faith in established traditions. Korranberg scholar Dravo Den Talas has proposed an alternate theory: that if there is any truth to the beliefs of the Blood of Vol, *all* divine magic could be drawn from the mystic spark of the caster. According to Talas, the actual belief is irrelevant; it is purely the strength of faith that matters.

Regardless of what they conclude, the various theories generally acknowledge that a paladin who worships the Lord of Blades doesn't actually have to draw their power from the Lord of Blades himself. The power might come from within the paladin, it could be ultimately drawn from Dol Dorn or Onatar--or even be a gift of the Traveler.

### Not All Clerics are Divine

Ultimately the distinction between divine spellcasting and arcane spellcasting is a question of flavor. There's nothing that says a paladin has to be considered to be a divine spellcaster. A kalashtar cleric could present their *command* as psychic ability, while a paladin from a cult of the Dragon Below could describe Divine Smite or Lay on Hands as being empowered by a disturbing symbiont that encases the arms of the paladin. Warlocks and barbarians might seem more thematically appropriate for many of the cults of the Dragon Below, but the same concept can be applied to clerics or paladins; while they are driven by their faith, their powers are based on gifts, physical mutations, or otherworldly revelation, as opposed to coming as a literal answer to prayer.

### Strange Gods

The Sovereign Host is by far the dominant faith of Khorvaire, followed by the Church of the Silver Flame, which has churches and shrines all across the Five Nations. While the Blood of Vol is a distant third, it has been well established in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities for over a thousand years. However, there are many other religions in the world. These include the druidic traditions of the Eldeen Reaches, the kalashtar Path of Light, and other faiths described in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. In addition, players and DMs can always develop new religions, either as traditions that have recently appeared or as obscure faiths that have few followers. A few examples of uncommon religions are provided below.

#### The Becoming God

- **Province:** The warforged (creation, evolution, ascension)
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Forge (*Xanathar's Guide to Everything*)
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Devotion

This small cult believes that the souls of the warforged flow from a greater spiritual power. Those who follow the path of the Becoming God believe that House Cannith was merely a tool of the Becoming God; Cannith created bodies, but it was the God that shared its essence and gave the warforged life. Followers believe that each warforged holds a divine spark, that their people have a destiny, and that when they work as one, they can change the world. Followers seek to ensure a positive future for the warforged race, seeking to reactivate the old creation forges or to find a new way to create warforged. The faithful are also charged with helping to build a physical body for the Becoming God itself, and a community of warforged in the Mournland labors toward this aim. It could be that this vessel will be a vast form that dwarfs even the warforged colossi, but perhaps the Becoming God's size doesn't matter, only its perfection. Followers of the faith may receive visions of objects that must be located and brought to the Mournland to help with this quest.

The cult of the Becoming God is notably less violent than the followers of the Lord of Blades. The faithful are determined to protect the warforged and help them reach their full potential, but they generally believe that it's possible to work with creatures of flesh and blood, and harmony is better than strife.

#### The Draconic Prophecy

- **Province:** Destiny, divination
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Knowledge
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Devotion

Priests of the Draconic Prophecy embrace the idea that there is a guiding force underlying reality, and that they can see glimpses of its divine plan. A priest of the Draconic Prophecy believes that their divine powers are granted to keep the Prophecy on its proper path--that when a cleric uses *cure wounds* to save a comrade, it's because that person isn't destined to die today. When they cast a spell such as *commune*, it doesn't contact an extraplanar entity, but reveals a cryptic glimpse into the Prophecy itself.

Despite having priests, this isn't an organized religion and there are no clearly established traditions. It's a calling, and each champion must find their own path. Priests of the Prophecy are often set in opposition to forces that seek to manipulate the Prophecy and to use it for their own ends, notably the fiendish Lords of Dust.

#### The Lord of Blades

- **Province:** The warforged (conquest, revenge)
- **Suggested Cleric Domains:** Forge (*Xanathar's Guide to Everything*), War
- **Suggested Paladin Oath:** Conquest, Vengeance

The Lord of Blades is a warforged insurgent. He asserts that the warforged were created as tools and weapons, but now it is time for their former masters to reap the harvest they have sown. Some of his most devoted followers--who call themselves Blades--believe that there can be no peace between the warforged and creatures born of flesh and blood, and that there will come an apocalyptic reckoning between the two. They don't believe the Lord of Blades to be a god, but they do consider him to be a divine champion. There is a parallel here to the Becoming God, as the Blades believe the Lord of Blades is the vessel for the spirit of their people, the fulcrum of their destiny; the primary difference is that the followers of the Becoming God seek peaceful coexistence, while the Blades devotedly believe in both conquest and vengeance.

Due to the antagonism between Blades and creatures of other races, this path would be an unusual choice for a player character, unless the entire party of adventurers is comprised of warforged. However, it's possible a Blade paladin could be pursuing a sacred mission--perhaps searching for a particular artifact or the secret of how new warforged can be created--that requires them to find a way to peacefully work alongside creatures of flesh. Perhaps along the way, they will conclude that coexistence is possible.

While the Blades believe that conflict is inevitable, they aren't fools, and few are bloodthirsty or cruel. Most Blades are combat veterans with tactical experience, and know better than to simply attack every human they encounter; when they act, they strike strategic targets and have a plan of attack. At the moment, there are working toward acquiring strategic resources, developing weapons, and striking at those perpetrating injustice toward the warforged. They may make bloody examples of their enemies, but most acts of violence are carefully planned.

## Aasimar

>Nara smiled as she faced the assembled fiends. "You're the ones who are outnumbered." Her spectral wings unfolded from beneath her cloak, rainbow feathers casting light across the chamber. "All of the champions of the Silver Flame are with me, and no evil can stand against our power."
>

Divine magic is usually the product of deep faith and unyielding conviction, but an aasimar has a direct tie to a source of divine power and receives guidance from a celestial entity. Usually, these gifts aren't hereditary, and you can't necessarily identify an aasimar in Eberron by their appearance; there is no single recognized trait that defines an aasimar, and no reliable way of producing one. While the existence of aasimar may seem to fly in the face of Eberron's distant gods, it's important to remember that an aasimar needs no direct connection to a deity. An aasimar draws power from a divine energy source, and their spiritual guide is a celestial being--an angel, a couatl, or similar spirit. The aasimar may be marked as a champion of the faith, but even they can't prove the existence of the Sovereigns.

Chapter 6 presents racial traits for aasimar of many faiths. As you create an aasimar character, consider these questions:

- **Faith.** Aasimar are touched by divine power... but which divine power are you connected to? Are you blessed by one of the Sovereigns, or are you a living servant of the Undying Court?
- **Apperance.** How does your aasimar nature manifest? Is it always obvious, or revealed by channeling celestial energy?
- **Devotion.** While many aasimar become clerics or paladins, serving as champions of the force they're bound to, the gifts of an aasimar are innate powers that don't rely on faith. Are you a servant of the light, or do you resist this divine calling?

The Faiths and Aasimar section discusses these first two questions, providing details about your appearance and faith. But the question of devotion is entirely in your hands. Do you want to play a champion of the light, a devoted servant of a celestial being? Or do you want to explore the story of a rebel, someone called to a divine destiny but refusing to yield to it?

As a general rule, aasimar are so rare and diverse in their appearance and traits that you wouldn't be recognized by the common populace. However, most people devoted to a particular religion will recognize an aasimar associated with their faith when you manifest your divine gifts. Aasimar are usually seen as blessed beings by those who share your faith, and they will likely assume that you are a devoted servant of that faith called to serve a divine purpose. By contrast, people who don't share your faith may not recognize your nature; for example, few outsiders are familiar with the manifestations of a Blood of Vol aasimar.

Your celestial nature might draw you into schemes or danger. Authority figures tied to your faith may have their own plans for you. There could be prophecies you're expected to fulfill. Or you could be targeted by enemies you never knew you had; perhaps the Lords of Dust need the blood of a Sovereign aasimar to complete a ritual that's performed only once in a generation. In creating an aasimar character, discuss this with your DM. What is the story you want to tell? Do you want to have a greater purpose and destiny, or to clash with hidden cults? What appeals to you about playing an aasimar character?

### Aasimar Origins

Aasimar have an innate connection to a divine power and a celestial guide. But when and how did this manifest? Were you born an aasimar, or was the power thrust upon you? The Aasimar Origins table presents a few possibilities.

### Faiths and Aasimar

As an aasimar, you're tied to a divine force... but which one? The Undying Court and the Silver Flame are both known sources of divine power, but they are quite different from one another. This section looks at the major religions of Eberron and how aasimar are typically tied to each faith, including common subraces and backgrounds for aasimar of that faith.

As you read, consider that as an aasimar in fifth edition, your celestial guide is one of your defining features, and their nature should be tied to the faith you're associated with. Work with your DM to establish the specific details of your guide using the information discussed in this section. Usually, spiritual guides only communicate through dreams and visions. Is this the case for you, or do you ever have more direct conversations with your guide? Does the guide make specific demands or assign you tasks, or are its pronouncements cryptic or vague? Is it testing you, or is it working to convince you to embrace your destiny? Are you the only aasimar tied to this celestial, or is it the patron of a group of aasimar--and if so, have you met any of the others?

#### The Blood of Vol

As an aasimar of the Blood of Vol, you weren't chosen by some distant angel; your power comes from within. The potential for divinity lies within you, and it is your own divine spark that guides you on the path toward ascension.

***Apperance.*** Seeker aasimar appear human. Some have a pale, almost vampiric complexion, while others appear exceptionally vibrant and healthy. Your eyes often glow when channeling divine energy, and your energy manifestations are typically red or black.

***Guide.*** Your guide is an aspect of yourself; think of it as the god you could become, working to guide you toward ascension. Guidance usually takes the form of instincts or visions; you can't converse with it directly. Is your guide primarily concerned with your own ascension? Or is it driven by the Seeker principles of protecting your community and opposing death?

***Background.*** Seeker aasimar are exceptionally rare; even followers of the faith often don't recognize your true nature. If you focus on protecting the innocent, you might be a folk hero. If you're pursuing personal ascension, you could be a sage or a hermit. Or you could be an urchin or an outlander who found your divine spark while struggling to survive.

***Subrace.***  As an aasimar of the Blood of Vol, use the Seeker aasimar subrace presented in chapter 6.

#### The Path of Light

Aasimar are rarely associated with the Path of Light, though the faith does have champions--the kalashtar--guided by otherworldly spirits. While anything is possible, the Path of Light has yet to produce aasimar.

#### Planetouched Aasimar

When you were born, you were imbued with a sliver of the immortal essence of an angel. Most likely this was an accident: you were conceived in a manifest zone at the precise moment the angel's physical form was destroyed, and while it reformed, a fragment of its spirit went into you. But it's also possible that the angel chose you to be its avatar or agent in the Material Plane. Either way, this spirit embodies the positive aspects of the concept of the plane (discussed at length in chapter 5), and it encourages you to embody that principle.

As a planetouched aasimar, your appearance is more exotic than most other aasimar. You have an alien aspect that reflects the plane and the angel you're tied to, and this becomes more dramatic when you manifest your abilities. Only scholars and sages might recognize you for what you are, while common folk will generally view you with curiosity.

The following planes are most likely to produce aasimar.

***Daanvi.*** You're tied to an angel that embodies the concept of law in the service of justice. Your skin and hair have a metallic sheen, often copper or bronze, and your wings have the appearance of clever clockwork. Daanvi aasimar typically use the protector subrace. Your instincts drive you to fight for the greater good, but within the structure of the law; you're more likely to have the knight, soldier, or city watch background than to be a vigilante folk hero. Your guide could be a planetar--a judge on an inevitable tribunal, who urges you to enforce the law. Or you could be bound to one of the solars of the Panopticon, each bound to enforce justice within a particular plane. Hazariel, the Solar of Syrania, has exiled radiant idols to the Material Plane; perhaps it's concerned about the damage these fallen angels are doing on Eberron and is grooming you to deal with them.

***Fernia.*** Your guide embodies the positive aspects of fire: the flame that provides light and warmth, driving back the darkness. Fernian aasimar typically have crimson skin, and eyes or hair that burn with cold flame. Use the variant Fernian aasimar provided in chapter 6. Your guide drives you to provide comfort to the frightened and to battle forces of darkness. Fernian aasimar are often sorcerers wielding elemental flame; the Divine Soul sorcerous origin is a good option to reflect your tie to your angel, or you can use the red dragon Draconic Bloodline origin, describing your features as angelic rather than draconic.

***Irian.*** You're bound to an angel of light, a spirit that inspires hope and life. Your skin and hair have a luminous appearance and your wings are formed from pure light; when you cast the *light* cantrip, you can describe it as your body itself radiating light. Most Irian aasimar use the protector subrace. Your guide could be a lesser angel, or more unusually, you might be tied to one of the Architects of Irian. Araam, the Architect of the Refuge, would urge you to provide hope to the hopeless. The Gardener would inspire you to heal the injured and fight for life. The Dawn Empress would charge you to achieve your full potential and help others do the same. Any of these could also direct you to battle the forces of Mabar--life-draining undead and other dark forces. As a champion of hope, you might be a folk hero or a hermit. Prince Lorrister of the Lhazaar Principalities is an Irian aasimar who has risen to rule the principality he calls the Heavenly Fleet; if you're tied to Lorrister, you might be a sailor or a noble.

***Mabar.*** You're connected to an angel that's trapped in Mabar and slowly being transformed by the plane's dark powers. Choose any other plane from this section; the angel is originally from that plane, and you have a generally similar appearance to other aasimar touched by that plane--but your colors are dull, as if the light is being leached away from you, and your eyes are pure darkness. Use the variant Mabaran aasimar provided in chapter 6. Your guide still inspires you to follow the principles of its plane of origin, but it's fighting against Mabar's overwhelming despair and a hunger to drain the light and life from mortal creatures; when you use your Consuming Touch, you're channeling this energy to your guide. Your guide might hope you can someday release it from Mabar, though no immortal has ever escaped its corruption before. Or it could simply encourage you to follow the general principles of its plane of origin--balanced against its growing hunger and despair. You might be an urchin or a hermit, haunted by visions of Mabar; or you could be a sage, seeking to unlock the secrets of the planes.

***Shavarath.*** The angels of Shavarath are martial champions. Your skin and hair have the appearance of iron or steel. Shavaran aasimar generally use the protector subrace, and your wings are formed from knives. If your guide is from the Legion of Justice, it urges you to fight for a just cause; you might be a knight or a soldier. If your guide is tied to the Legion of Freedom, it urges you to battle all forms of tyranny and oppression, perhaps leading you to be a folk hero. This can be an interesting option for a Hexblade warlock; your guide has given you their celestial weapon, and it urges you into battle.

***Syrania.*** You are tied to a dominion of Syrania. Each dominion has a particular domain, reflecting its area of influence and interest; is your dominion an angel of war? Of nature? Of commerce? What's its specialty within that broad domain? Syranian aasimar typically use the protector subrace, and have classic feathered wings; however, your appearance might reflect the domain of your guide in some way. Your guide will urge you to exemplify its domain--if it's the Angel of Swords, it will want you to master the sword! It also observes the world through your eyes, and it might send you to observe events or take actions tied to its domain.

> ##### Aasimar, Genasi, and Tieflings
>
>What's the difference between a Fernian aasimar, tiefling, and genasi? They're all exotic humanoids touched by fire.
>
>Aasimar are touched by the positive aspect of a plane, and have a direct connection to a celestial from that plane. A Fernian aasimar embodies the benevolent role of fire, the force that preserves life and holds darkness at bay. People who recognize such aasimar see them as blessed, and typically assume they will be benevolent beings.
>
>Tieflings are touched by the malevolent aspects of a plane. The Fernian tiefling reflects the destructive and chaotic aspects of fire, and it's widely believed that fires can spontaneously start in their presence. When recognized, tieflings are seen as being cursed and dangerous.
>
>Genasi aren't innately fiendish or celestial; they're purely elemental. While quite rare, when recognized, a genasi is generally understood to be neutral in nature--a remarkable mutation, but not something to be feared or celebrated.
>

#### The Silver Flame

The Silver Flame is the most common source of aasimar in Eberron. Some believe that Tira Miron was an aasimar of the Silver Flame; it's likewise possible that all Keepers of the Silver Flame become aasimar when they assume their post. Most followers of the Flame have heard stories of champions with rainbow wings, and they will place their trust in you once your true nature is revealed.

***Apperance.*** Typically, Flame aasimar appear entirely human until they reveal their rainbow-feathered wings. However, some Flame aasimar manifest other couatl traits, like having rainbow feathers instead of hair or serpentine eyes. There are rumors that there's an entire race of serpentpeople--the Shulassakar--devoted to the Silver Flame. The manifestations of a Flame aasimar's energy are either silverywhite or prismatic.

***Guide.*** Typically, your guide is a couatl--one of the beings who first brought the Flame into existence. Another option is that you are in touch with the Voice of the Flame itself, the ascended spirit of Tira Miron. The primary purpose of the Flame is to protect the innocent from supernatural threats. Is this what your guide encourages you to do? Or do you have a greater purpose?

***Background.*** If the church leaders are aware of a Flame aasimar, they are typically embraced by the church, and you could take the acolyte or soldier background to reflect this--choosing soldier if you're primarily a templar, acolyte if you're a friar. On the other hand, your spiritual guide could have reached out to you in spite of your having no prior ties to the faith; folk hero, urchin, or even criminal could work for this story.

***Subrace.*** Flame aasimar use the protector aasimar subrace, manifesting rainbow-feathered wings reminiscent of the couatl. An aasimar corrupted by the Shadow in the Flame could shift to the fallen aasimar subrace.

#### Sovereigns and Six

Host aasimar are chosen by a particular Sovereign, or at least, by a celestial devoted to that Sovereign. As a Host aasimar, you are encouraged to act as an avatar of that Sovereign, embodying their virtues and inspiring the faithful. If you're an aasimar of Dol Arrah, be the most virtuous warrior possible. If you're an aasimar of Aureon, acquire knowledge and use it to guide others and strengthen civilization. Followers of the Host generally show respect to Sovereign aasimar, and may ask you for assistance.

Aasimar of the Dark Six are exceptionally rare, and may be better represented by tiefling statistics.

***Apperance.*** Host aasimar typically appear fully human, usually conforming to the common image of the archetype the Sovereign embodies--the sturdy blacksmith for Onatar, the wise sage for Aureon, the weathered farmer for Arawai. Energy manifestations are typically golden light.

***Guide.*** Your guide is a celestial devoted to the same Sovereign as you--typically an angel of Irian or Syrania. They will encourage you to embody the virtues of the Sovereign you represent. Do they have any deeper purpose for you?

***Background.*** Host aasimar are chosen, not born, and they're usually chosen because they already embody the necessary virtues of the Sovereign. Common backgrounds might be that of a guild artisan for Onatar or Kol Korran, soldier or knight for Dol Dorn or Dol Arrah, sage for Aureon, outlander for Balinor, and criminal or charlatan for Olladra (though with a virtuous heart!)

***Subrace.*** A Host aasimar might use a variety of subraces. Protector aasimar is a common option, but scourge aasimar is valid as well. An elf aasimar devoted to the Host could use the Court aasimar subrace provided in chapter 6, while an aasimar tied to Onatar could even use the Fernian variant.

#### The Undying Court

You have been chosen by one of the ascendant councilors of the Undying Court--one of your deathless elven ancestors--and imbued with a fraction of their power. You serve as their hands and eyes in the world beyond Aerenal, while proving your worth to ascend to the Court yourself.

***Apperance.*** As an aasimar of the Undying Court, you physically resemble an Aereni elf. Most Aereni aasimar appear like normal elves, with luminous eyes and a general aura of health. However, you could have a desiccated appearance, similar to a mummy--even though you are still fully alive and healthy. Your energy manifestations are typically blue or violet.

***Guide.*** Your spirit guide is one of the deathless councilors of the Undying Court, quite possibly one of your own distant ancestors. Do they want you to serve the general interests of Aerenal and the Undying Court, or have they recruited you as their personal agent? Do they want you to help in a struggle with a deathless rival, in pursuit of the Draconic Prophecy, or in a conflict over corruption within the court itself?

Elves don't dream, but your ancestor can speak to you when you trance. Your ancestor was once mortal themselves, and your relationship may be more direct and personal than the typical relationship between aasimar and guide.

***Background.*** If you are a recognized agent of the Undying Court (or a member of the undead-fighting Deathguard), you could take the acolyte or soldier background, with its feature reflecting the authority you wield as an envoy of the Court. If you're a covert agent, you might be a spy or charlatan. The hermit background is a good choice if you were cloistered for many years before you were chosen by your guide, who revealed a great secret to you.

***Subrace.*** As an Aereni aasimar, use the Court aasimar subrace presented in chapter 6 to reflect your elf nature.

> ##### Nonhuman Aasimar
>
>Aasimar aren't limited to humanity. Flame aasimar appear among the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes, and Host aasimar could be born from any of the myriad followers of the Sovereigns. How does this work with a race whose traits assume human ancestry? As far as appearance, where an aasimar is described as "appearing human," you could instead say that they appear to be an orc, hobgoblin, or any other race. When it comes to racial traits, however, your nonhuman aasimar won't have any of the mechanical traits associated with your heritage. You can say that your aasimar appears to be a dwarf, but they won't have resistance to poison or the Stonecunning trait.
>
>If it's important to you that your aasimar character feels like a member of another race including those racial traits, you can work with your DM to develop a subrace reflecting your heritage, much like the Court aasimar uses the subrace to give an aasimar core elf traits such as the ability to trance. But nothing comes for free; if you're gaining traits tied to another race, others need to be removed to balance their power. On the other hand, if you're satisfied with cosmetic changes--while you look like a dwarf, you're not actually resistant to poison--it's easy to use any subrace to represent aasimar of other races.

# Chapter 4: Uncharted Domains

![Artist: Olie Boldador](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/80%20olie%20boldador.jpg)

>>Dela could feel the mind flayer's hatred, inflaming the anger of the crowd around her. His thoughts washed over her as he made his announcement to the gathered monsters. *Outsiders came to Graywall, scheming to steal an ancient treasure from our governor's palace. These arrogant easterners have been taken into custody, and within the hour they'll fight their first match in the arena. Who will stand as the champions of Graywall? Who will spill the blood of the East?*
>>
>>The crowd around Dela roared as one. The minotaur in front of her raised his axe--made on a Karrnathi forge, from the look of it--and bellowed his righteous fury. Dela was glad for the illusion that made those around her see her as an orc; this was a bad moment to be the only human in the crowd.
>>
>>A sudden sense of calm silenced the mind flayer's rage. It was Gentle; the kalashtar's telepathic projection momentarily shielded Dela from the governor's wider projection. *Do not fear, Dela. We'll save them.*
>>

The nations of Galifar have been detailed in many books, from *Five Nations* to *Sharn: City of Towers*, with relatively little attention given to other areas. This chapter delves into four regions and cultures that have never been explored in depth: Droaam, a nation of creatures most humans consider to be monsters; the goblinoid Heirs of Dhakaan, keepers of an ancient legacy; the dwarves of the Mror Holds, caught in a conflict with the terrifying daelkyr; and the denizens of the Thunder Sea.

## Droaam

Of all the new nations to rise from the Last War, Droaam is both the youngest and most exotic. It is an alliance of creatures often seen as monsters, founded by villains who stepped out of storybook tales. Denied recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold, Droaam remains an enigma. How did this nation come to be, and what could draw adventurers to it?

### Droaamish History

For the last millennium, children of the Five Nations have known the fate awaiting the naughty: they'll be sent to the Barrens, where ogres will use them for footstools until the trolls eat them for dinner.

When Galifar was established, the province of Breland was granted dominion over all lands south of the Byeshk Mountains and west of the Seawall, extending to the waters of the Thunder Sea. This bold claim considerably extended the territory held by the preceding nation of Wroat--but it was nothing more than a claim. The Brelish people had no need of the lands to the west, nor did they want them. The Barrens--their name for everything west of the Graywall Mountains--were known to hold foul swamps and barren plains, an untamed region filled with all manner of deadly monsters. Explorers to Breland's newly acquired territory soon confirmed these tales. The plains were filled with goblins and hungry gnolls. The mountains were home to harpies whose songs could lead the unwary into deep chasms, where trolls slept on piles of bones. The Barrens had nothing the Brelish believed worth fighting for, and so it was left alone. Occasionally, questing knights or bold templars would cross the Graywall to battle giants and slay ogres, but the region was largely ignored.

Over centuries, the Brelish slowly expanded west toward the Graywall. Castle Arakhain became a favored royal residence in the eighth century, bringing new prosperity to Ardev and Shavalant. However, the ensuing wave of western settlers was met by fierce raiders crossing the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake. Bloodied settlers brought back tales of bellowing minotaurs, orcs, ogres, and goblins lurking in every shadow. An attack at Castle Arakhain led to the brief Westward War, the might of Galifar driving the raiders back across the Graywall and obliterating many of the marauding bands. The fortress Orcbone was established as the gate between the people of Breland and the monsters of the Barrens, and the king founded the Westwind Riders to patrol the border. The Riders held the line throughout the ninth century, and Brelish settlers even staked claims along the Graywall. This period peaked with the founding of the fortress-town of Stubborn in the foothills (now known as Stonejaw). Then the Last War changed everything.

#### An Ancient Land

The land known as the Barrens is far older than Galifar or Wroat. While less fertile than the fields of Breland or Aundair, this region holds rich mineral deposits. Some believe it was the original homeland of the goblinoids, a theory supported by a significant number of Dhakaani ruins along and below the mountain ranges, as well as below the Great Crag itself. In the Graywall Mountains, a set of thousand-foot statues commemorate the six kings who came together to form the ancient Empire of Dhakaan. But while this region may have once been important to the dar, it was utterly devastated in their war against the daelkyr, compounded by the return of forces long held at bay by the empire. Vicious gnolls swarmed south from the Towering Wood. Fierce orcs emerged from the western swamp. Trolls and ogres came down from the mountains. Those dar that remained were infected with daelkyr curses; instead of standing together against the invaders, they turned on each other, and centuries of chaos and bloodshed followed. By the time it was done, all that remained of Dhakaan was ruins. Hobgoblins and bugbears had been eradicated in the region, and goblins were scattered and divided.

The region was dominated by anarchy from then on--some believe this merely follows the natural instincts of the region's inhabitants, while others point to the lingering influence of the daelkyr. There were a few bastions of civilization--the Venomous Demesne, the hidden village of Lost--but the people of these communities had no interest in expanding their culture; they were either fortified, hidden from the outside world, or both. Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as "chieftain," but it literally means "boss" or "big person"--and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll--a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind. But while powerful, these creatures lacked the ambition or drive to build anything that could last. Occasionally a more intelligent leader--a minotaur warlord, a charismatic oni--would build a greater force, perhaps even establish a dynasty that would last a generation or two before being overwhelmed by the relentless, brutal tide.

#### The War Begins

As the Last War began, the harpies held the Byeshk Mountains, where their flights endlessly feuded. Cazhaak Draal was in the hands of the medusas that claimed it centuries earlier. Wise creatures knew to avoid the Watching Woods, home to worgs and worse. In the plains, the strongest leader was the minotaur warlord Rhesh Toraa; around her keep, countless minor chibs fought one another more frequently than they struck the settlers.

The first days of the Last War led to a reduction of forces in the west of Breland; while it was a violent, unstable region, there were few settlers across the Graywall needing protection. Not all of the Westwind Riders were Brelish, and with Wroaan's coronation, soldiers returned to serve their home nations, and Wroaan needed all the troops she could muster. She reduced the Westwind Riders to a minimal force--enough to patrol between the fortresses of Orcbone and Stubborn, but little more.

Many Aundairians had been part of the Westwind Riders, and on receiving their reports, Spy Master ir'Galanatyr saw an opportunity. The Royal Eyes of Aundair worked with Rhesh Toraa and other chibs in the Barrens, providing equipment and training to support attacks against Graywall settlers and raids across the gap. With forces tied up to the east, it was up to the commanders of Orcbone and Stubborn to protect the west. But ultimately, the provocateurs from Aundair and Karrnath found the Barrens raiders undisciplined and impossible to unify, never posing the dire threat Breland's enemies had hoped for.

#### The Daughters Arrive

The fortress-town of Stubborn survived decades of raids and skirmishes, as the chibs of the Barrens had no patience for sieges and no weapons for breaking strong walls. Many lesser settlements and claims were overrun and lost, but Stubborn repelled countless attacks by goblins and minotaurs. However, it was utterly unprepared for the force that struck it in the last decade of the war. A typical band of raiders might include a single troll or a handful of ogres, but in 986 YK, the soldiers of Stubborn found themselves facing phalanxes of armored trolls fighting with deadly skill, and squads of ogres acting with discipline and coordination. Stubborn's defenders leapt off the walls in pursuit of harpies' songs, and the walls were shattered by hurled stones. Survivors were herded into the plains to face the leaders of the army; this was the first recorded encounter with the assembled Daughters of Sora Kell, three enigmatic hags discussed in depth later in this chapter.

"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west," Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. "What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors."

Once news of the fall of Stubborn reached Orcbone, the Westwind Riders traveled west in full force. But Sora Katra was true to her word; there were no survivors, nor any records of the last battle of the Westward Riders. A retaliatory strike from Droaam--merely a fraction of the forces at Stubborn--inflicted terrible damage on Orcbone itself. King Boranel swiftly deployed all the soldiers he could spare to this new front, reinforcing and fortifying Orcbone. In 987 YK, he formally ordered all Brelish citizens to withdraw from the lands west of Graywall, but he refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Daughters, and over the next decade, clashes continued.

#### Building A Nation

To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere--and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya's Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya's Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved--that Maenya's lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation--but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.

Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with--and dominated--the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.

In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region's most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient--when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters--Maenya's Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.

The Daughters' ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam--at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Gargoyles and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. In Sharn, the Gargoyle replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable.

#### The Present Situation

The Daughters of Sora Kell sent representatives to Thronehold for the treaty negotiations, demanding to be recognized as a sovereign nation. This petition was denied. In practice, Droaam its territory. But legally, the land is still part of Breland. It's debatable whether the Droaamites are legally invaders or rebels defying the Brelish crown, but either way, they aren't considered citizens of Breland and aren't entitled to the protections of the Code of Galifar. However, their standing outside the law makes them a haven for war criminals, dissidents, deserters, and others who can find no place in the Five Nations.

Most of the leaders of the Five Nations are convinced that Droaam won't last--that it's unstable, that these monsters will turn on each other any day now. They might be right; the Daughters have already had to crush a number of rebellious warlords and lesser chibs. But after eleven years, Droaam is stronger than ever. Its new cities are expanding. Dragonmarked houses are exploring their opportunities in the region. One important question still remains unanswered: What do the Daughters of Sora Kell want? Will they attack Breland in force if their demands aren't soon met? Or is there some grander scheme, tied to the prophetic visions of Sora Teraza?

### What Defines Droaam?

While all citizens of Droaam serve the Daughters of Sora Kell, each region is independently governed by a warlord in the name of the Daughters, and beneath them, chibs rule local communities. All citizens are expected to serve their nation when called upon, and to do whatever is asked of them. In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride--driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east. The people of Droaam are encouraged to believe that they are part of something glorious, something that has yet to be fully formed. "Today may be difficult, and tomorrow may be harder still. But look what we've done in one decade, and imagine what we'll achieve in the next!"

Within Droaam, some citizens have concrete, defined jobs--miners, masons, soldiers. Others are part of a general labor pool and may change jobs daily. This is especially true in the great cities, which are constantly expanding. However, Droaam isn't yet a highly organized bureaucracy, and it's easy to slip through the cracks if you choose to. Within the major cities, many citizens pursue their own businesses. Those who appear to be indolent or who cause trouble are swept up by a press gang, but people displaying industry and contributing to their city are largely ignored. Ultimately, Droaam is still a frontier; the nation is only ten years old, its cities are still being built, and there's much change yet to come.

While many outsiders may think Droaam's system sounds oppressive, most of its citizens are sincerely committed to their new nation. Their lives before the Daughters were brutal and ugly. Now they have all the grist--ground meat made of troll flesh--that they can eat, a roof and a bed in the local hall, and most of all, a sense of purpose. A goblin may spend their day in the mines, but they know they're building a great city, not just serving the crude whims of a crass ogre chief. Additionally, many citizens are truly in awe of the Daughters of Sora Kell, a careful balance between fear and wonder--the practical fear of Sora Maenya and her Fist, and the dreams inspired by the words of Sora Katra. The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.

#### Language

Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.

When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.

Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common--and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma (Performance) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.

Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.

While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in *muut* or *atcha*, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms *chaat'oor* or *gath'dar* to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use *aravaat*--easterner--to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it.

#### Political Structure

The nation of Droaam, which has only existed for eleven years, has a general structure established, but it's constantly evolving. The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice. As it stands, Droaam has been split into *lheshat*--a Goblin term meaning "domain of a warlord." Each lheshat is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the Daughters; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the Daughters.

For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city--though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent. Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse--foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.

In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:

- The agents of **Katra's Voice** are envoys and entertainers, diplomats and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Most of the agents of Katra's Voice are changelings, but medusas, tieflings, and even harpies can be found in this role. Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.
- A few elite soldiers of **Maenya's Fist** usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.
- The agents of **Teraza's Eye** are sages, versed in the region's history and diverse customs. They survey ancient ruins and identify manifest zones and planar conjunctions. They often offer unsolicited advice to local warlords. Though the smallest of the three branches, some believe that those Eyes that are seen are merely the tip of the ankheg--that Teraza is served by changelings and other hidden agents who carry news of all developments back to the Daughters.

These names are the titles both of the organization and its officers; an agent acting on official business simply says, "I am Teraza's Eye, and you will tell me what transpired here."

#### Law and Order

Droaam isn't bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.

Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers--anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall--but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.

In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.

There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it--but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice--but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.

Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.

A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; *everyone* clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her--he needs to know better--but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters.

#### Cruel World

Mercy and compassion are alien concepts in Droaam, neither expected nor offered. There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey--and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.

Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.

This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement.

#### The Economy

Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary "currencies." Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth--so you can't just carve "wyvern" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage--"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver"--adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam--or is perhaps even an ally--there won't be a bounty on its teeth.

While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter--any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.

Droaam's main exports--brokered through House Tharashk--are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!

In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the Droaamish Artisanship table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne.

#### Religion

Droaam is a tapestry of many cultures with diverse beliefs. The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Demesne believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.

Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed--an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.

The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered "monsters" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.

Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find *your* path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species--from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.

All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.

Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.

There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam--the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered "supernatural threats." The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone.

#### Cuisine

Why did it take so long for the people of the Barrens to build great cities? In part, this was because they couldn't feed the population of such a city. Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.

While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the "grist mills" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish--for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.

Every major town has a "grist mill"--a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate--though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily--stew, sausage, meat broth--but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew--there's plenty more where it came from!

For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland.

#### Wide Monster

It's commonly said that Eberron is "wide magic, not high magic." The civilization of the Five Nations is based on the application of low-level arcane magic, which is deployed to solve the problems of society--communication, entertainment, warfare. In Droaam, however, the Daughters of Sora Kell are building a civilization based not on wide magic, but wide monster--finding civic applications for the supernatural gifts of their diverse citizenry. The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But what happens when your tool is a medusa or a gargoyle? Here are a few applications to bear in mind.

***Harpy Song.*** The people of the East know of the harpy as a monster whose voice can lure innocents to their death. But a gifted "songbird" can produce a far wider range of effects than just the irresistible lure. The song of a talented harpy can inspire hope or despair, instill joy or bring tears to the eyes of listeners. Harpies call the start of each work shift, drawing workers to their tasks. Every grist mill has a songbird whose magical voice soothes weary workers at the end of a shift. As harpies can project with supernatural volume, songbirds also call out the hour and serve as town criers, relaying important news across a community.

***Medicine.*** The chirugeons of Droaam employ methods that are more gruesome than those of House Jorasco, but these techniques are nonetheless effective. Broodworms are a form of maggot whose secretions help to both anesthetize a patient and cleanse infected wounds; tiny gelatinous cubes are also used as an unusual anesthetic. While it's not yet in wide use, the Daughters have been experimenting with troll's blood, a salve with remarkable healing properties that may in fact be exactly what it proclaims to be. Droaam is a harsh land, and most of the time when people suffer the answer is "suck it up," but the Daughters have pledged to make a better world in days to come. If they manage to perfect and mass-produce *troll's blood*, it could revolutionize public health.

***Brute Force.*** With its many ogres and giants, Droaam has raw strength in great supply. Many tasks that would require specialized equipment or beasts of burden in the Five Nations are simply performed by a large and powerful humanoid.

### The Denizens of Droaam

The population of Droaam is staggeringly diverse. In addition to the sentient creatures that are part of this culture, the region is home to a remarkable number of monstrosities and exotic beasts. In part, this is due to the ancient influence of the daelkyr and the more modern experiments of Mordain the Fleshweaver. There are a considerable number of manifest zones in the area, along with passages to Khyber. But most of all, this has been a frontier for thousands of years. The central region of Khorvaire has long been home to powerful civilizations, and over time, its people actively worked to eliminate dangerous threats. Some monsters were exterminated, while others were driven away--and Droaam is one of the places they were driven to. There may have been a time when trolls and manticores roamed freely across all of Khorvaire; now, Droaam is the land of monsters.

So Droaam is a place where you can meet three impossible things before breakfast--and one of them may be the one serving you breakfast. While there are enclaves--such as Cazhaak Draal and the Venomous Demesne--that are largely populated by a single species, most of the great cities of Droaam are diverse communities hosting all manner of monsters. It's important to recognize just how varied the inhabitants of Droaam can be. There are significant differences in basic biology, psychology, and intellect. Ogres, trolls, hill giants, and ettins possess great physical power but are not as intelligent as humans, and Droaam's other citizens know to express things in ways they can understand and not antagonize them unnecessarily. Gargoyles are elementals and don't eat or drink; if you want to make a kind gesture to a gargoyle, you don't offer it a drink, you present it with a riddle.

Here's an overview of the most common sentient creatures in Droaam and the roles they play in society.

***Changelings.*** The changelings who leave their city of Lost often work directly for the Daughters. Most use their skills as part of Katra's Voice, serving as entertainers, mediators, and bards; others gather information as Teraza's Eyes. Unless they have reason not to, the changelings of Lost wear their true faces; however, they use their shapeshifting aesthetically, creating exotic or ever-changing patterns across their skin. Skindancing is a changeling art that blends physical motion with transformation, and it can be a remarkable experience.

***Gargoyles.*** Since the rise of the Daughters, gargoyles have been deployed across Droaam; they are also favorite recruits of House Tharashk. Civilian gargoyles serve as messengers and couriers, while most warlords also have a unit of combatready gargoyles that serve as scouts and rapid response. As elementals, gargoyles don't eat, sleep, or drink, and they can remain motionless for months or years. While gargoyles have traditionally been depicted as cruel predators, the fact is that they love the *thrill* of hunting. They yearn for challenge, and love riddles and puzzles almost as much as hunting prey.

***Giants.*** The mountains of Droaam are home to ettins and hill giants, both of which are native to Khorvaire. Ettins are distantly related to orcs, while the hill giants of Khorvaire are a form of ogre; while they use the same stat block as the devolved hill giants of Xen'drik, they aren't actually related. In the Barrens of the past, giants would come down from the mountains and dominate groups of goblins and kobolds. In Droaam today, they have primarily been drawn into heavy labor, as well as providing raw power to the armies of Droaam. Giants are not especially bright; as long as they are fed well (which requires a lot of food!) and celebrated for their efforts, they are generally content to serve their purpose.

Vralkek is also home to a small contingent of giants from Xen'drik that found a home in this land of monsters. Most serve the fire giant Gorodan Ashlord, or at least acknowledge him as their spokesman to the Daughters of Sora Kell.

***Gnolls.*** The gnolls of Droaam are described in more detail later in this section, and playable racial traits are presented in chapter 6. Every major city has a garrison of gnoll soldiers, who protect the interests of the Daughters. These gnolls aren't part of Maenya's Fist, and generally serve as peacekeepers rather than being used in punitive actions. Some warlords hire additional gnolls to serve their own personal agendas. While almost all gnolls in Droaam serve as mercenaries with the Znir Pact, there are always those whose services aren't currently contracted. Idle gnolls often work as hunters, selling fresh game to the local markets; grist is sustaining, but there are many creatures who prefer other meat when they can get it.

***Goblins and Kobolds.*** Both goblins and kobolds were once oppressed underclasses within the Barrens, dominated by almost every other species in the plains. Over time, they developed their own shared culture that's entirely different from the cultures of either species elsewhere in Khorvaire; when someone says "goblin" in Droaam, it's understood that they mean "goblins or kobolds." Most goblins and kobolds feel a close kinship and look out for each other. They learned long ago to value cunning over strength; the heroes of their tales are quick and clever. They are patient and enduring, and tolerate endless suffering while waiting for an opportunity to present itself.

Those goblins who serve the Daughters of Sora Kell lead far better lives than their ancestors in the Barrens, and they are among the most numerous inhabitants of the large cities--and the most devoted supporters of the Daughters of Sora Kell. Most are especially excited about Kethelrax the Cunning, the kobold warlord; they believe that this marks the beginning of a new age where goblins will be recognized and rewarded for their work. However, there are still goblins in the domains of some warlords--notably Turakbar's Fist--who live miserable, short lives. While most goblins are content to focus on their work, some seek to help their oppressed kin or take petty vengeance on ogres and giants for the vast suffering inflicted on their people.

***Harpies.*** The harpies of the Byeshk Mountains claim to be the children of the Fury, and they take joy in flight and song. They are wild and passionate, embracing love and hate alike with reckless abandon. Those harpies who left the mountains to "sing Katra's song" have embraced her vision and are thrilled to be building a nation with their voices. They are generally more intelligent than the standard harpy in the *Monster Manual* and have more control of their supernatural voices, being capable of inspiring a range of emotions. Harpies call the hour and summon workers; they also help with crowd control, serve as town criers, and entertain the people.

In representing a harpy character or interacting with one, highlight their passion. Harpies *love* what they do; if they don't, they won't do it. Singing isn't merely a magical tool; it's a joyful act, a communion with the Fury and a work of art woven together. Whether singing weary goblins to sleep in a grist mill or acting as a courier in Sharn, harpies embrace life with absolute zeal. But harpies hate just as strongly as they love--and there are harpies who hate the Daughters and the entire idea of Droaam.

>The harpies who work with the Daughters of Sora Kell are more intelligent than their cousins, and have learned to use their remarkable voices--which they can amplify up to three times as loud as normal--for more than just luring enemies.

>A typical harpy songbird has an Intelligence of 10 (+0), a Wisdom of 12 (+1), and a Charisma of 14 (+2), along with the skills Performance +6 and Persuasion +4. A remarkable songbird might be able to cast spells from the bard spell list.
>
>The Byeshk harpies are also capable hunters renowned for their skills as archers; most harpies in Droaam are proficient with light armor and bows.
>

***Humans.*** Most humans living in Droaam are easterners--brigands or renegades evading the law, or merchants seeking opportunities. However, a few are natives, serving Droaam as part of the Venomous Demesne. While the demesne's nobles are tieflings, humans are a significant part of the population, and Demesne humans can be found serving as magewrights in other cities. The humans of the Venomous Demesne have little in common with the people of the East and feel no kinship to the Five Nations.

***Medusas.*** There are relatively few medusas in Droaam, but their intelligence and mystical power makes them a vital part of this growing nation. Medusa architects direct construction in the blended cities, laying the foundations of what this nation will become. Medusas who choose to serve as Voices of Katra are often called upon to resolve disputes and enforce justice, for who dares challenge the ruling of a medusa? Cazhaak Draal is also the seat of the most organized religious tradition in Droaam--the worship of the Dark Six--and most powerful priests of the Six are medusas. Compared to many denizens of the region, medusas tend to be calm and rational; however, they expect to be treated with respect and aren't above a few harsh lessons to make a point.

The medusas of Droaam are capable of receiving visual impressions through their serpent mane, and can close their primary eyes to prevent any threat of petrification. Medusa magewrights can also master a ritual--the Medusa's Kiss--that undoes the effects of medusa petrification, allowing this power to be used in a number of useful ways (such as preserving the life of a creature about to die). Medusas can control the movements of their serpents, and the medusas of Cazhaak Draal have developed a simple sign language called Serpentine that uses the movements of the serpents to convey messages. Other species can learn to understand Serpentine as an exotic language, but there's no way to speak it without a mane of living serpents.

***Minotaurs.*** The minotaur clans of Droaam are spread across the plains. They are fierce barbarians and warriors who dominated goblins, kobolds, orcs, and other creatures in the days of the Barrens, and to this day, it is these clans that often lead raids into Droaam. However, this fierce aggression has prevented the minotaurs from becoming a major power, due to the long, destructive feuds between the clans themselves.

The minotaurs believe that they are the chosen warriors of a being commonly known as the Horned Prince, and they hone their skills in battle so they may join the Prince after death. Each clan has their own private name for the Prince and their own beliefs about the conduct he expects of his followers. In most cases, the Horned Prince seems to be an analogue to the overlord Rak Tulkhesh, desiring only bloodshed. However, the Red Hooves worship He Who Walks Behind, who is much like the Mockery; they focus on the use of terror and in deceiving their enemies. The Blade Breakers worship One Horn, who rewards strength and courage--much like Dol Dorn. The Dawn Harvest was a clan whose version of the Prince--the Dawn Gorer--encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in Droaam. The Dawn Harvest was destroyed by Maenya's Fist after refusing to accept Rhesh Turakbar as the warlord of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across Droaam.

Minotaurs are fierce and brave, but they generally lack patience and discipline; they are terrifying raiders, but most have trouble with large-scale tactics and operations.

***Ogres.*** Ogres are more common than their giant cousins, but fill much the same role in society. Physically powerful but somewhat dimwitted, they pursue simple pleasures: food, drink, and crushing small creatures that annoy them. The warlords charm them with harpy song and fill them with grist, then set them to work lifting heavy things and smashing things that need to be smashed. They're often recruited in local "brute squads" and serve as basic shock troopers in the armies of Droaam.

Ogres fall below human standards on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma; not only do they struggle with rational thought, they're impulsive and relatively weak-willed, and in many ways can be treated as mighty children. While physically powerful, they're easily swayed by strong personalities and compelling stories. They are very emotional--though they can shift between emotions rapidly--and love stories and songs, even if stories need to be kept simple. It's not uncommon for an ogre to develop a deep attachment to its favorite harpy or changeling storyteller.

> ##### Skullcrusher Ogres
>
>The skullcrusher ogres of Maenya's Fist are a different subspecies from common ogres. They are devoted to their duties and don't socialize with other creatures.
>
>A typical skullcrusher ogre has a Dexterity of 12 (+1), an Intelligence of 10 (+0), and a Wisdom of 10 (+0). They are proficient with heavy armor and martial weapons, and typically wear plate armor. Skullcrushers are well trained and act with military discipline.
>

***Oni.*** The origins of the oni are a mystery. Some people believe oni are the offspring of hags and giants, and that some are children or grandchildren of the Daughters themselves. Other stories claim there's a kingdom of oni in Khyber, likely a demiplane, and that the oni of the surface world are criminals banished from this wondrous realm. While rare, their intelligence and power make them valuable to the Daughters of Sora Kell. The oni Tzaryen Rrac is a trusted warlord, while other oni serve as commanders in Maenya's Fist, inquisitors in Katra's Voice, or administrators throughout the realm.

Oni are cunning and curious. Some serve the Daughters in exchange for treasure, others for arcane lore, while some are simply content with the power they hold as agents of the hags. You could tie their broader goals to their true origin--if the oni are exiles from a hidden kingdom, they might be building power to reclaim that kingdom. If they are the children of the Daughters, they could be competing with one another to impress their parent, and generally engaging in sibling rivalry.

***Orcs.*** Over countless generations of life in the Barrens, the orcs of the region developed two distinct cultures. The larger of the two are the *Gaa'aram*--Children of Wrath. The Gaa'aram embraced the chaotic, raiding lifestyle of the Barrens. Where the goblins and kobolds were often forced into service by more powerful creatures, the Gaa'aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa'aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa'aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they're the reason for the name of the Orcbone fortress that guards the Gap of Graywall. Gaa'aram orcs can be found in all of the diverse cities, and they're usually passionate supporters both of Droaam and their local warlords.

In the days before Droaam, few people of the Five Nations had even heard of the smaller of the two cultures, the *Gaa'ran*--Children of Sacrifice. The Gaa'ran orcs are pacifists and farmers--one of the only cultures to farm in the open Barrens. They believe that violence stains the soul--that those whose souls are pure pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa'ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torture and death, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa'ran settlements to stand--with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa'ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa'ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.

The Gaa'aram and Gaa'ran are both local cultures with no direct ties to other orcs of Eberron. Gaa'aram orcs are among those monstrous mercenaries House Tharashk has recruited in Droaam. The Gaa'ran have a talent for primal magic that suggests they were once tied to the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches, but they are not Gatekeepers and don't fight aberrations; their interest lies solely in cultivation.

***Shifters.*** There are a significant number of shifters among the humanoid population of Droaam. In the former Barrens, shifters were largely mixed together with the Gaa'aram orcs, much the same way that the goblins and kobolds of Droaam have formed a collective culture. These orcs call shifters *taarka'va*--wolf brothers. Pairings between shifter and orc can produce offspring, but the resulting half-orcs are almost always sterile.

Another group of shifters are found in the Watching Woods. They call themselves *Ur'haakar*--First Panthers. These shifters shun civilization and take pride in their primal connection. Experts at stealth, they possess both Hunter rangers and Living Weapon monks. A few of the Ur'haakar have joined the Dark Pack and left the woods to serve the Daughters and Droaam, but most of the panthers prefer their isolation and consider the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack to be corrupted shifters.

***Tieflings.*** The Venomous Demesne lies in the west of Droaam, hidden by powerful illusions. It was founded by tiefling refugees from the ancient Sarlonan kingdom of Ohr Kaluun, and its four ruling families possess great knowledge and vast arcane power. Tiefling wizards and warlocks can be found serving as Katra's Voice or Teraza's Eye. The people of the Venomous Demesne--including a significant human population--look down on both the inhabitants of Droaam and the Five Nations, but they value their alliance with the Daughters of Sora Kell and are willing to suffer some indignities for this cause.

***Trolls.*** In the Barrens, trolls often established themselves as chibs. A clever troll would gather a band of Gaa'aram orcs and dominate (and occasionally eat) a pack of goblins and kobolds, ruling a tiny fiefdom with strength and fear. This arrangement still persists in places, especially around Turakbar's Fist. Elsewhere, trolls have been drawn into the greater society of Droaam, serving in the military or performing heavy labor; those trolls who refuse to cooperate are "sent to work at the grist mills." Given this, most trolls aren't too disruptive to society. However, trolls expect to be treated with respect by smaller creatures--if you're killed after you insult a troll, it's considered an unusual form of suicide, not a fault on the part of the troll.

Trolls are proud of their strength, and enjoy engaging in tests of strength, like tug of war or lifting, with other trolls or ogres. While they generally dismiss smaller creatures, a troll is impressed by anyone that performs remarkable feats of strength; they generally respond better to intimidation than to diplomacy.

> ##### War Trolls
>
>Like the skullcrusher ogres, the war trolls of Maenya's Fist are a unique subspecies that may be the result of magebreeding. They are utterly devoted to Sora Maenya and to Droaam.
>
>A typical war troll has a Strength of 22 (+6), a Dexterity of 14 (+2), an Intelligence of 10 (+0), and a Wisdom of 12 (+1). They are proficient with heavy armor and martial weapons, and typically wear plate armor; a war troll could be granted additional features to reflect its considerable skill.
>

***Worgs and Lycanthropes.*** In the wake of the Lycanthropic Purge, many lycanthropes fled to Droaam. Most congregated in the Watching Wood under the leadership of the werewolf Zaeurl. However, there are a few independent lycanthropes scattered across the region. At the end of the Purge, the power of the curse of lycanthropy was weakened, and most of these survivors couldn't spread the curse to others; they could only pass it to their offspring. Keen to avoid any chance of further persecution, many of these renegade lycanthropes spent their lives solely in animal form. Even today, most members of the Dark Pack are born in animal form and consider it their true form. The natural lycanthropes of Droaam have the ability to speak in beast form, as worgs do, though this gift isn't passed on to creatures they afflict with lycanthropy.

In time, Zaeurl forged an alliance between the renegade lycanthropes and the native worgs of the Watching Wood, and this bond--the Dark Pack--remains strong to this day. However, just as there are a small number of lycanthropes with no ties to the Pack, there are worg packs scattered across Droaam. Worgs would often ally with Barrens chibs, and gnolls of the Barrakas clan often form bonds to worg companions. In general, the people of Droaam are quite comfortable with the presence of large predators, and it's polite to say *ta kuur*--You speak?--to a beast you've never met before.

In recent years, the potency of the lycanthropic curse has returned. Under the rules of fifth edition, all lycanthropes can spread the curse, but the Daughters and Zaeurl both wish to avoid spreading lycanthropy--at least for the moment. The Dark Pack follows strict instructions--*don't bite unless you intend to kill.* As with trolls, most town guards understand this rule; if your friend picks a fight with a werewolf, sorry, it has to kill them after biting them; that's just a matter of public safety. Sora Katra is studying the curse of lycanthropy and may develop ways to prevent accidental contagion... or instead, she might develop a program of carefully managed infection to create a new corps of lycanthrope soldiers.

***Others.*** These are the common species of Droaam, but there are many more that could appear. Mordain the Fleshweaver unleashes strange things into the world. Manifest zones can create monstrosities. And in general, the creatures of Droaam haven't been subject to the expansion of a great nation and their subsequent extermination, unlike other regions. There may be a colony of yetis in the mountains. A lamia may rule over an ancient Dhakaani ruin. There may not be a large community of manticores, but you could easily find one living in Graywall. The Daughters of Sora Kell find a place for every creature.

### The Daughters of Sora Kell

The destruction of Stubborn and the declaration of Droaam came as a terrible shock to the people of the Five Nations. This wasn't the work of an upstart prince or an ogre chieftain. Both Sora Katra and Sora Maenya were known from countless tales--mostly terrifying ones in which things don't end well for the heroes. To most people, the Daughters were legends, figures used to scare unruly children. The Daughters were the reason you were afraid of the darkness as a child; Sora Maenya could be lurking in the shadows, waiting to add your skull to her collection. Most people of the Five Nations know nothing of the daelkyr or of the Dreaming Dark, but they know the Daughters of Sora Kell. This is one reason the Five Nations have refused to acknowledge Droaam; at the end of the day, they can't believe that it is real, and they hope that maybe they'll wake up tomorrow and realize it was all just a bad dream.

In principle, the Daughters of Sora Kell are hags. Sora Katra is a green hag, cunning and charismatic. Sora Maenya is an annis hag, possessed of tremendous strength and hunger. And Sora Teraza is a dusk hag, who sees the tapestry of the future laid out before her. However, calling Sora Katra a green hag is like calling a legendary bard a "human." It's a foundation--a basic archetype to begin with. But all of the Daughters possess powers far beyond what's normal for hags of their type. Their mother was Sora Kell, one of thirteen immortal night hags said to have been created by Eberron and Khyber at the dawn of time. Each had a different father; in some stories these were fiends, in others, giants. Regardless, they possess inherited power, which has only increased over centuries of schemes and adventures. While the Daughters are usually spoken of together, each is a legend in her own right; they each have their own goals and distinct personality, and each one can offer different hooks for story or adventure.

#### Sora Katra, the Voice of Droaam

The stories of Sora Katra are many and varied, for she's a gifted shapeshifter who seems to love meddling in the lives of heroes. She's the old woman at the inn whose idle comment sows doubt in lovers' hearts. She's the tinker who gives the farmboy the magic sword that helps him become king--the same blade he uses to kill himself in the final act. It's only through a wink to the audience or a hint to the reader that Katra's true identity is revealed. In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring *tragedy.*

However, Sora Katra isn't always the villain in tales. When she acts openly, she often poses a challenge that tests the hero's wits or resolve. In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge--which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them--and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It's this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.

Sora Katra is known as a schemer. In many stories she's found weaving curses on her loom--plotting misery and misfortunes to release into the world. In the tale *The Sleeping Prince*, she curses the Prince of Wroat three days after his birth. In the end of the story, the Woodcutter's Daughter kills the giant in the King's Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter's Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra's motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn't kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter's Daughter--did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there's no question that Katra's actions always bring misfortune to *someone*--especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.

Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples' anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want--such as the ambitions of her warlords--and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal--just as the prince in *The Sleeping Prince* was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter's Daughter. It's possible Droaam is another of her tests--but who's being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?

In her natural form, the Mistress of the Mires is a green hag, with green skin and dark green hair. However, she loves illusion and rarely remains in her true form. If she has no reason to remain in a particular form, she often shifts in mid-speech. She delights in forms with a personal impact on the people she's dealing with--taking the face of a dead lover or a betrayed friend. She possesses abilities like a powerful bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.

Sora Katra loves challenging heroes, which makes it easy to tie her to a story. Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters--she's spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince--who Katra torments, seemingly without reason--or are they the Woodcutter's Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character's backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character's family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?

#### Sora Maenya, the fist of Droaam

Sora Maenya is often depicted as a monster, said to wander the Towering Wood. She is known for her strength and her endless appetite; it's commonly said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. Stories often depict her through her absence, as an unstoppable force that punishes arrogance or cruelty. The shepherd warns the foolish farmers not to settle in the forbidden meadow; later, he returns to find their bones picked clean and stacked near the hearth, but without their skulls. There's no need to say who it was or to show the battle. The tale notes the missing skulls, and everyone knows that Maenya keeps the skulls of her victims, binding their souls to the bone and using them as lanterns.

Maenya greatly enjoys games and challenges, and she may spare someone who shows spirit. While she doesn't lay out schemes as complex as does Sora Katra, there are many tales of Maenya wandering the woods in disguise and tricking travelers into unwise contests. Her endless appetite reflects a broad love of life; it's not simply that she's hungry, it's that she loves to eat. She fights for the sheer joy that comes in crushing an enemy, and in the folk song *Edar's Last Jig*, she dances until her partner dies of exhaustion. She seems to have a sense of humor, albeit a morbid one; she may spare someone who makes her laugh, or let someone live because it amuses her to do so. There are stories where a hero beats her in a seemingly impossible contest through cunning and courage; when defeated, she honors any promise she has made. However, a victor would be wise not to gloat; in the tales, this is a sure path to an unexpected end.

Sora Maenya is the general of Droaam's armies, the iron fist that crushes any rebellion. The core of her power is Maenya's Fist, an elite corps of war trolls and skullcrusher ogres. Everything about the Fist is shrouded in mystery. Some say Maenya bred and trained them in a buried Dhakaani fortress; others say that Maenya herself forged the imposing plate armor that they wear. Whatever the truth, the members of the Fist are fanatically devoted to Maenya. While Droaam has yet to assemble an army combining the full force of its warlords, thus far, Maenya has shown herself to be a brilliant and unorthodox strategist, one not to be underestimated.

In her natural form, Sora Maenya is an annis hag--a towering, powerful figure. She can assume smaller forms, but rarely seeks to play psychological games with her shapeshifting as Katra does. She appears in many tales as a hungry woman--tall and thin, with ragged clothing and long black hair, seeking shelter and food. While her primary power is her martial might, she does have supernatural gifts; the most infamous is her soulbinding. And perhaps she also has other necromantic skills that haven't been revealed in the tales...

While she's known for her immense strength, Sora Maenya isn't just a brute; there are stories in which she actually trains a hero, either teaching them to fight or granting them unnatural strength. While it would be an unusual path, a monk or barbarian could attribute their class features to early training with Sora Maenya. The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain--asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she'll come to collect. Or perhaps it's the other way around; perhaps as a child, the character defeated Maenya at a game, and it's she who owes the character a favor.

> ##### Trapped in a Tale
>
>One thing that makes the Daughters interesting is that they aren't simply mundane tyrants or warlords. They're legends, and have matched wits with countless heroes. One way to reflect this is to provide them with powers that aren't easily represented or replicated by the standard rules of play. For example, when a character is negotiating with Sora Katra, the DM might ask the player, "Tell me a time in your childhood when you broke a promise." Sora Katra might then bring that story up: "I watched you through your window that night, warrior. I chose not to take your finger then, for I'd had my fill that evening. But why should I trust you today, when you broke your word to your childhood friend?"
>
>There's no saving throw against this and no mechanical effect. It simply demonstrates that Katra has powers and influence that can't be measured or fully defined. Perhaps she's using some form of telepathy and the whole thing's a con. Or perhaps she was there that night. The point is that she's not just a powerful bard; no one knows exactly what she can do. Likewise with Teraza's visions, or the idea that Katra can weave curses on her loom--like eldritch machines, the limit on these abilities is whatever the story needs them to be.

>In many ways, the Daughters feel like characters pulled out of faerie tales, and the DM could draw inspiration from elements of Thelanis from chapter 5 (such as curses). But the Daughters are natives of Eberron, not archfey from Thelanis. As such, the Daughters are extremely powerful and long-lived, but they're ultimately mortal; they should be very difficult to kill, but they can die. In addition, archfey largely cannot change, and continue to play out the same story indefinitely. The Daughters are part of Eberron, and as shown by Droaam itself, they may have their preferred themes, but they can create entirely new stories.

#### Sora Teraza, the Dream of Droaam

Sora Teraza is the most enigmatic of the Daughters of Sora Kell. She's known to be blind, yet she's perfectly aware of her surroundings; it's not that she can see, she simply *knows* where everything is. In some tales, it's said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It's also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people--books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.

Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she's not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn't always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge--that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn't actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn't as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.

Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there's an Aundairian war criminal--a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for--hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart--leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information--via *dream* or *sending*--that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn't mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza's knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it's a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it.

### Why Go to Droaam?

Droaam is a wild frontier filled with monsters. It stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. The common races of the East are outsiders here, and unloved. Why would sensible adventurers ever go to this dangerous place? The simplest answer is that it provides opportunities for stories you can't tell anywhere else, precisely because it is beyond the laws of the Five Nations. It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold. It's an opportunity to make bargains you couldn't make anywhere else, and to find adventures that don't exist elsewhere.

#### Patrons

The Daughters of Sora Kell could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. The party could be agents of Daask, which is considered a criminal organization outside of Droaam. But the Daughters are heads of state, and the characters could also be legitimate envoys of the nation--even if Droaam isn't currently recognized as a legitimate nation. This is a great opportunity for players to create a team of monstrous characters. While some creatures don't easily translate to low-level play--there's no simple way to make a 1st-level war troll--it's easy to play orcs, shifters, changelings, goblins, kobolds, and minotaurs. In addition, chapter 6 presents new racial traits for creating gnoll characters. In creating a monstrous character, consider if you're from one of the new blended cities or from an old enclave; is your first loyalty to the Daughters of Sora Kell, or to your personal warlord? Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?

As agents of Droaam, adventurers could be sent on personal missions for the Daughters: perhaps investigating a mystery that threatens to cause an uprising, dealing with a rebellious warlord, or recovering an important artifact from a Dhakaani ruin. Or they could act as envoys in the wider world, whether negotiating with possible allies or simply acting as goodwill ambassadors showing people that the nation of monsters need not be feared.

#### Peculiar Needs

There are many unusual items that can only be found in Droaam--perhaps an artificer needs basilisk eyes to complete their latest invention. Droaam is also the only source of a number of strange alchemical concoctions, such as dragon's blood and blood gin; it's also possible that a character from the Five Nations is sent to Droaam not to obtain dragon's blood, but to find out exactly who's creating it and how. Droaam is also a place where you can openly interact with powerful priests of the Dark Six; if the adventurers need the help of a high-level cleric of the Keeper, Graywall may be the closest and quickest option.

#### Peering Into The Past

Droaam contains a significant number of Dhakaani ruins, as yet untouched by the greedy hands of Morgrave explorers. In some cases, these ruins remain unspoiled because they're haunted, infested with twisted aberrations, or claimed by wild monstrosities or other monsters, such as the medusas living in Cazhaak Draal. Both Graywall and the Great Crag are built atop Dhakaani ruins, and whether adventurers are searching for lost artifacts of the dar or terrifying tools of the daelkyr, there could be legendary treasures hidden in the depths.

The daelkyr Orlaask was active in this region, and there are passages to its demiplane prison beneath Cazhaak Draal and Suthar Draal. Dyrrn the Corruptor was also involved in ancient battles in this region. According to some accounts, it was here that Dyrrn released the contagious curse known as the Kapaa'vola (discussed later in this chapter), and this is why the region's goblins are so different from the Darguuls and the Kech Dhakaan; could the key to undoing the curse be found here?

#### Politics

Breland is worried that Droaam is preparing for a major assault on its western border. Other nations--especially Aundair--might encourage such an action. The Daughters of Sora Kell could repeat their request for recognition; the Eberron novel *The Queen of Stone* covers such a summit. Meanwhile, all of the dragonmarked houses are interested in possible business opportunities in Droaam. Any of these interests could take a party of adventurers to Droaam, whether they are acting as spies or working openly as envoys.

#### Pursuit

Droaam--and Graywall in particular--is a common destination for dissidents, deserters, brigands, and war criminals. It's a growing city that stands outside the laws of the Five Nations. While it's a city of monsters, it has a thriving foreign quarter, home to a major enclave of House Tharashk and a growing number of dragonmarked outposts. It's the perfect place to hide out, and a group of adventurers could be hired to retrieve someone from Droaam, or have a more personal stake in things.

A villain whose scheme goes afoul in Sharn could flee to Graywall; how badly do the characters want revenge? Or the adventurers could learn the location of someone who plays a role in the more distant past: an old enemy from the Last War, someone responsible for the death of comrades-in-arms or the destruction of their home village. Are they seeking an Aundairian war mage responsible for countless civilian deaths, or a Brelish noble who tried to assassinate King Boranel? Alternatively, the characters could find that an old friend is hiding out in Graywall, but they are being targeted by a powerful enemy; can the adventurers reach them in time to help?

### The Gnolls of the Znir Pact

There have always been gnoll clans in the Barrens, though the Dhakaani goblins ruthlessly exterminated gnolls in imperial territories, driving them back into the wilds. But their story starts long before. In the dawn of time, Eberron was the domain of the fiendish overlords. This was an age of chaos, as the overlords constantly clashed with one another. **Rak Tulkesh**, the Rage of War, commanded armies of fiends, while the Wild Heart raised hordes of ravenous beasts. In the struggles between the two, the Wild Heart bred dire hyenas with the ability to consume the immortal essences of the Zakya warriors of Rak Tulkhesh. But the Wild Heart failed to anticipate how consuming fiends would affect its creations. Twisted from within by the immortal essence of the demons they'd devoured, the hyenas were warped into something entirely new, something that was neither beast nor demon: and so the first gnolls were born.

Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns. The fiendish spark burned within them, and when they weren't directly serving the Lords of Dust, most engaged in vicious acts of brutality. The Rage of War seeks endless battle, and when there is no greater conflict, it delights in setting its minions against one another. For countless generations, gnolls fought troll, ogre, and other gnolls seeking blood for their hungry idols.

Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin--then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as *Znir*--a word that simply means "stone"--and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one--not chib, god, or demon--to hold dominion over them.

This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even just holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all of the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact.

Some scholars of the Five Nations find it strange that the Znir Pact never took the path of conquest. There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally--to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles--but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.

#### Znir Clans

The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan's moon.

The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls--though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.

#### The Demon Within

The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Znir simply refuse to allow the demon within to hold dominion over them. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence--to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return.

In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as *hwyri*--Gnoll for "warden"--and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats. There has been some tension between the Vult and the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack; the Vult shamans suspect that the Pack is vulnerable to the influence of the Wild Heart.

So as a gnoll, there is a spark of demonic influence within you. The Znir learn to control this at an early age. But how does it manifest in you? Do you suppress it completely, or do you channel it in some way--possibly reflected by your class abilities? Are you a hwyri who seeks to fight supernatural threats, or are you not concerned with such things?

> ##### The Myrnaxe
>
>As mercenaries in a land of monsters, the Znir gnolls prepare to face a wide range of exotic opponents. With this in mind, the Eyre clan produces a weapon they call the *myrnaxe*, named for the smith who created it. A myrnaxe has a sturdy wooden haft with a curved axeblade on one end and a long spearhead on the other. Functionally, a myrnaxe is a battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either slashing damage (with the axe blade) or piercing damage (with the spear). It's common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk--thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes.
>
>The Znir consider the myrnaxe a signature weapon of their pact and don't sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a myrnaxe is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe.
>

#### Gnoll vs. Gnoll

Droaam is a small place, and the Znir serve any who will pay a fair price. This inevitably leads to conflict between Znir gnolls fighting for two opposing sides. In such situations, Znir fight one another with all their skill, but they strike to wound, not kill. A gnoll wounded by another gnoll immediately withdraws from battle, no matter how superficial the wound. While some clients take umbrage at this--"You can still fight! Get back out there!"--this is an absolute rule of all Znir contracts, and gnolls who defy this are punished by the united clans.

#### Mercenary Service

While Droaam has risen around them, the Znir Pact continues as it always has. They don't work for shelter and grist, and expect to be paid for their service. This is perfectly acceptable to the Daughters of Sora Kell, who have placed a full half of the Pact forces on extended retainer. Most large communities have a Znir garrison employed by the Daughters. These troops are present to protect the region from brigands or invaders, and to help maintain order. But they serve the Daughters, not the local chib; it's understood that if the chib or their warlord turns against the Daughters, the local Znir will act against them. The remainder of the Pact serves other masters, and many warlords of chibs employ Znir gnolls as bodyguards, enforcers, or hunters.

The Znir take their contracts seriously. If the client breaks the terms of the agreement, the contract immediately ends; but as long as terms are met, Znir will face any danger and never betray a client. They have earned this reputation over the course of centuries, and this gives them a place much like the Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith in Khorvaire; everyone knows that the word of the Znir is as unbreakable as stone.

House Tharashk has begun brokering the services of Znir gnolls within the Five Nations, but the Pact leaders are cautious about this arrangement. Within Droaam, Znir customs are known and respected, and the Znir can unite against anyone who defies them. The Znir recognize that they don't hold such power over the rulers of the Five Nations, and are concerned about serving so far from their stones. In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world. This scouting role is a reasonable path for a gnoll player character; it's their job to travel the world beyond and learn its ways, and to make friends and allies.

#### What Defines the Znir?

Here are some common characteristics of gnolls--some of them biological, others cultural--that can help make a Znir character come alive.

***Physical Apperance.*** A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on clan, this can be uniform in color, or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green, and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of the gnoll sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don't grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation.

***Bone Eaters.*** Gnolls possess powerful jaws, as reflected by their bite attack. They can chew through and digest bone, and dislike letting food go to waste. When feral gnolls raid a village, they consume even the bones of their victims. Znir gnolls won't eat their fallen foes if they're in the company of creatures who are uncomfortable with such behavior. But they often eat a small piece of any creature they slay--even if it's just a finger--to form a bond with the victim. The Znir believe that those you kill wait for you in the realm of death, and honoring them ensures that they won't be hungry when you travel to that land.

***Pack Instincts.*** Gnolls have very strong pack instincts. They instinctively work together in combat, and think nothing of placing themselves in harm's way to protect their kin. Znir gnolls won't deceive members of their pack; if there are problems, they call them out directly. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters--but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don't show them the same respect.

***Casual Aggression.*** Gnolls often seem very aggressive to other creatures. However, gnolls themselves don't consider casual intimidation to be a hostile act; it's just a way to establish a place in the hierarchy of the pack, largely ignored once that hierarchy is established. This manifests in how gnolls make demands rather than requests, and use active statements rather than passive queries.

***Cunning Hunters.*** Gnolls are strong and aggressive by nature. But both the Znir gnolls and their uncivilized kin are cunning hunters rather than simple brutes. Gnolls work together as a pack, always searching for weaknesses in enemies and supporting injured allies. Znir goals won't break their word, but they don't hold to any idea of honorable conduct on the battlefield; they are ruthless and efficient, and see nothing wrong with ambushing or tricking a superior foe. Some gnolls have a supernatural knack for mimicry (which could be represented by the use of *minor illusion* or the Actor feat) and use this gift to draw enemies into danger.

***Working Relationships.*** Droaam is a diverse region, and the Znir gnolls have always been prepared to work for any master. They don't judge people by appearance or by their beliefs; just as they put up with demon-worshiping minotaurs in Droaam, a Znir hwyri can work alongside a templar of the Silver Flame or a warforged paladin of Dol Arrah. They may not like the people they are working with, and they may think that the beliefs of their companions are vile or foolish. But they place duty before such personal concerns, and won't insult allies or pick fights with them.

***Communication.*** The Gnoll language is unique, with a range of pitches that are difficult for humans to hear, let along duplicate. At first, it sounds much like the vocalizations of hyenas, with whining and chattering "laughter." It's possible for non-gnolls to learn Gnoll, but it's a difficult feat. When stealth isn't necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it's common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond.

Body language and posture--usually slumped--are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises up. The Znir dislike written communication, though they use it for contracts.

## The Heirs of Dhakaan

![Artist: Olie Boldador](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/96%20olie%20boldador.png)

>>*Raat shi anaa:* the story continues. In the distant past, six mighty kings rose to power. Each sought to do their duty to their people: to bring them prosperity and security, to defeat all who would threaten them. Time and again, the six kings clashed on the field of battle, but the kings were matched in cunning and their warriors were equals in courage and skill. No victory could be won, and no compromise could be found. Jhazaal Dhakaan called the six kings together, and none could resist her summons. She brought them to a field soaked with blood and strewn with blunted blades.
>>
>>Jhazaal Dhakaan sang the song of the dar, reminding the kings that they were all one people. She sang the song of muut, of the duty all dar share. She sang the song of atcha, of the glory awaiting the people, of the heroes of the past and of those yet to come. With her words, she wove a dream, and she gave that dream to the six kings and to all who followed them. It was with this song that the Empire of Dhakaan was born, and it is this dream that guides us still.
>>
>>Our empire was so grand that even the spirits grew jealous. The Lords of Madness crawled out of the shadows. They made monsters of our children and sought to break our people with terror. But no power could stand against the champions of Dhakaan. Our heroes blinded the Lord of Eyes and cut the roots of the Rotting Queen. They fought the great Corruptor and brought him down, but even as he fell, he whispered to the hero who defeated him. His foul words lingered, clinging to the champions, and they drowned out Jhazaal's song. As the whispers spread, those who heard them forgot the ways of muut and atcha. They forgot the glorious dream. They forgot what it meant to be dar. The duur'kala and the chot'uul came together, but there was no easy answer; only time would still the poisoned words. Our greatest leaders each took one of the treasures of our people and bore them down into the depths, into ancient fortresses that neither enemy nor poisoned word could penetrate. And there we remained, waiting for the echoes of that ancient curse to die, waiting to restore the dream of the people.
>>
>>Now that time is upon us. We have risen from our vaults and returned to a world that has been twisted by madness. Chaat'oor--defilers--have built foul cities on our foundations. The so-called "goblins" who remain have forgotten their glory and what it means to be dar. We must unite the Keepers of Dhakaan. We must reclaim our ancient treasures and crown the Emperor Yet to Come. And under their banner, we shall cleanse this land and restore our tarnished dream.
>>
>>*Raat shan gath'kal dor:* the story stops but never ends.

### Goblin History

Little is known of the origins of the goblinoid species. Aereni records describe warring goblinoids on Khorvaire around forty thousand years ago, when the elves settled on Aerenal. But recent studies suggest that the goblinoids themselves appeared quite suddenly around this time. It's commonly believed that the goblinoids evolved in vast caverns below the surface, but some modern scholars hold competing theories. Kel Kador of the Library of Korranberg believes that the goblinoid subspecies were magebred from a common ancestor, and that this goblin progenitor might still be found underground. Hass Holan of Morgrave University has advanced a more exotic theory--that the goblinoids may have emerged from a demiplane within Khyber, from a warlike realm that has yet to be found. The goblins themselves have little interest in the origins of the *dar*--a Goblin word meaning "the people." For them, the history of Dhakaan is the history of the dar. The two are considered synonymous, and regardless of their origins, the Dhakaani culture emerged approximately sixteen thousand years ago.

The legend that opens this section deals with the roots of the Empire of Dhakaan, when six hobgoblin kings fought over ancient Khorvaire. Jhazaal Dhakaan was the greatest duur'kala bard of the age and the artifacts she crafted are testament to her remarkable power; the warhorn *Ghaal'duur* in chapter 7 is one of her creations. If the legend is to be believed, Jhazaal Dhakaan performed a feat of epic magic. She crafted the dream of an empire and bound the goblinoids of the time to this dream. This *Uul Dhakaan*--Dream of Dhakaan--gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first *marhu*--emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.

The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the *duur'kala*--dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance--identified the threat but couldn't find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the *Kapaa'vola*--the Treacherous Whisper--had faded. These armies called themselves the *Kech Dhakaan*, Keepers of the Empire--a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.

On the surface, the remnants of the empire fragmented and collapsed. As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor--artificers of Dhakaan--and the duur'kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth--that the foundations they'd built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel. It was in this time that the terms *goblin, bugbear,* and *hobgoblin* took root, even among the former dar themselves.

The oppression of goblins persisted for more than a thousand years, while bugbears and hobgoblins remained hostile forces in the fringes, dwelling in the wild lands ignored by humanity. When Galifar Wynarn began his conquest of the Five Nations, he promised freedom to any goblin who fought under his banner, Goblin soldiers played a vital role in the war that followed, and Galifar remained true to his word. Despite this freedom, goblins were still often treated with prejudice and suspicion, and denied education and other tools for success. Even today, goblins can be found in every major city of the Five Nations, but an overwhelming number live in poverty.

In the shadow of Galifar, goblinoid cultures continued to develop and evolve. The most widespread were the Ghaal'dar tribes of the Seawall Mountains. While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal'dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued *muut* and *atcha*--their duty to their people and their personal honor--though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the *chaat'oor*–the non-native defilers--who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal'dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat'oor in the process.

And then in 969 YK, chieftain Haruuc of the Rhukaan Taash led the uprising that claimed the lands of southern Cyre and founded the nation known as Darguun. Little did he know that other eyes were watching. Khesh'dar scouts and spies had been gathering information on the world above since the beginning of the Last War. The founding of Darguun made it even easier for the Silent Folk to move within the world. The duur'kala of the Kech Dhakaan concluded that the Kapaa'vola had faded; these Ghaal'dar might be victims of the daelkyr curse, but associating with them posed no threat to the Uul Dhakaan. And so, over the last two decades, the Keepers of Dhakaan have emerged from their vaults and returned to the world above.

> ##### The Two Meanings of Ghaal'dar
>
>*Ghaal'dar* is the Goblin word for "mighty people." It has always been the Dhakaani term for the hobgoblins, just as the goblins are *golin'dar* ("quick people") and the bugbears are *guul'dar* ("strong people"). When used in lowercase--ghaal'dar--it refers to a hobgoblin of the Kech Dhakaan. However, when capitalized--Ghaal'dar--it's the name of the federation of hobgoblin-dominated tribes that dominate modern Darguun. The Ghaal'dar tribes are not Dhakaani; they mimic some of their customs and are proud of their imperial history, but they were twisted by the Kapaa'vola and differ from the dar in many important ways.
>
>Likewise, *dar* means "people." While common in the Goblin language, within this book, it's generally used to refer to the Dhakaani goblinoids who were unaffected by the Kapaa'vola. Today, the Ghaal'dar and other Darguuls have largely adopted the human words for their kind--goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear. Dar--the golin'dar, ghaal'dar, and guul'dar--are the original goblinoids who resisted daelkyr corruption.

#### The Uul Dhakaan

To unite the Six Kings, Jhazaal Dhakaan created a dream they could share--a vision that bound them all together. However, this isn't just a metaphor. When mortals sleep, their spirits touch Dal Quor and create temporary dreamscapes. Jhazaal Dhakaan bound the spirits of the dar together, creating a vast, permanent dreamscape within Dal Quor--a vision of the ideal empire. With the spirit of every dar tied to this place, when one of them sleeps, they dream of the empire and their place within it.

The Uul Dhakaan isn't oppressive. Each dreaming dar has their own unique dreams within the Uul, and just like normal dreams, these are a place to process recent events and experiences. But the Uul Dhakaan provides a foundation that shapes and flavors those dreams, teaching and inspiring even while allowing the dar to process their own experiences. The Uul Dhakaan also retains the memories of all those who have gone before. While dreaming in the Uul Dhakaan, a warrior could experience a battle against the daelkyr that occurred thousands of years ago, fighting alongside one of the greatest heroes of that age. A smith could forge a blade alongside a legendary daashor. These things aren't real; both the hero and the smith are dreams, pieced together through memory. And as with any dream, the dreamer likely won't remember most of it after they wake up. But it remains in their subconscious as a source of inspiration and instinct. The dar *know* what the empire could and should be. They *know* the role they are supposed to play, the meaning of muut and atcha. And they *feel* the connection to the dar around them, understanding they all share that common vision. As discussed in the next section, this reinforces the other aspects of the Dhakaani psyche, strengthens their martial discipline, and underlies their adherence to caste roles.

The Uul Dhakaan is a dream, and for most dar, it's nothing more than that. It's not something they discuss with outsiders, nor something they give much thought to from day to day; dreaming of the empire is just a part of life. But there are a few people within each kech who deal with the Uul Dhakaan in a more concrete fashion:

- **Chot'uul.** The "dream watchers" are an order of monks who monitor the Uul Dhakaan and protect it from corruption. In addition to specialized training and mental discipline, the chot'uul employ tools to retain their full consciousness and memories while dreaming, even allowing them to bring prized possessions into the dream. These *uul'kur* and *kra'uul* items are described in more detail in chapter 7. The chot'uul protect the Uul Dhakaan from quori manipulation, the corruption of the daelkyr, and other spiritual threats.
- **Duur'kala.** A dirge singer's training often includes time within the Uul Dhakaan. An *uul'kur* allows the novice duur'kala to experience historical events within the dream or to study with the memory-shades of duur'kala masters.
- **Uul'kala.** The "dream singers" are dirge singers who specialize in walking in dreams. The deep vaults of the Kech Dhakaan are spread across Khorvaire, and the uul'kala act as their ambassadors and emissaries, maintaining communication between each kech and planning strategies. This serves a similar role to the *speaking stones* of House Sivis, for a duur'kala equipped with an *uul'kur* can report back to superiors in their dreams. While useful, this practice isn't as widespread as the speaking stones of the Five Nations. *Uul'kur* are a limited resource, and even with one, it takes skill to navigate within the dream. There are kech vaults that lost their last uul'kala over the centuries in isolation, and as a result, that clan's fate remains unknown to the present day.

The Uul Dhakaan serves as a foundation for the Dhakaani psyche, reinforcing their beliefs and traditions. But it's not an oppressive force, and for most Dhakaani, it's simply a source of instinct and inspiration. In creating a Dhakaani character, consider whether the Uul Dhakaan holds any special importance for you.

> ##### Adventuring in the Uul Dhakaan
>
>The Uul Dhakaan is a stable region within Dal Quor. Dar are naturally drawn to it when they sleep, but it's possible for other creatures to stumble on it by accident, or even to seek it out. Chot'uul monks guard the dream, along with guardians formed by the dream itself, but this security isn't absolute.
>
>There are many reasons adventurers might seek out the Uul Dhakaan. It holds the memories of the Dhakaani Empire, and could contain secrets about a weakness of daelkyr or locations of ancient relics. The King's Citadel might try to infiltrate the dream to learn more about the plans of the Kech Dhakaan. A Dhakaani character might need the help of other adventurers to repair some sort of disruption or corruption within the dream; are the chot'uul unable to see it, or have they themselves been corrupted? Again, while it is a repository of knowledge, the Uul Dhakaan is a dream, not designed for maximum efficiency or ease of use. Elements shift and change. You can revisit an ancient battlefield, but you'll have to find that battlefield, or find a way to call it up from the collective well of memories. The uul'kala and chot'uul are trained to find their way around the dreamempire, but such travel isn't always quick or easy.
>
>At the DM's discretion, a character that serves as an uul'kala or a chot'uul might possess rituals that allow them to draw allies into a dream, each maintaining full consciousness within the Uul. Otherwise, dream adventures will require tools like the *uul'kur* presented in chapter 6.
>
>So far, the quori have largely ignored the Uul Dhakaan. If anything, the stability of the dream-empire supports the overall goals of the Dreaming Dark, and the chot'uul are always watching for outside forces manipulating the dream. However, a campaign could explore a quori attempt to subvert the Uul, or consider the consequences of an alliance between the uul'kala and the Dreaming Dark. The Uul Dhakaan was formed in the current age of the Dreaming Dark; the Dhakaani know nothing of the quori belief in the Turning of the Age, and no one knows what will happen to the Uul Dhakaan when this occurs.

#### Who Knows About the Dhakaani?

When humans first came to Khorvaire, they knew nothing of the fallen goblin empire. What does the typical citizen of the Five Nations know today? Can a Brelish soldier tell the difference between a Ghaal'dar mercenary and a Dhakaani duur'kala? For that matter, what do the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins know about the Heirs of Dhakaan?

Anyone who has received the common education of the Five Nations knows that there was a goblin empire that fell before humans arrived on Khorvaire. Recalling the name "Dhakaan" requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. With a DC 15 check, a character also knows broad details--the territory controlled by the empire, the timeline of its rise and fall, the role of the subspecies, and its clashes with other cultures. A DC 20 check provides very detailed information: the importance of muut and atcha, the names of specific rulers, perhaps even the knowledge of the Kapaa'vola and the belief that some clans fled from this threat. Goblinoids of Darguun are more broadly familiar with their history, and would certainly know the name of the Empire of Dhakaan, know about the duur'kala and the Silent Clans, and understand the idea of muut and atcha, even if they don't experience these concepts in the same way as the dar. Darguuls must still make a history check to recall the names of specific heroes or events tied to the empire, but generally receive advantage on such checks.

So this is what people know about the fallen empire--but what about the Kech Dhakaan and its many clans? Do people know the origin and goals of the Keepers? This is more complicated, as the Kech Dhakaan have chosen to hide in plain sight. Before Darguun, goblinoid tribes and clans were scattered across the wilds of Khorvaire. When Haruuc established his nation, many unknown tribes stepped out of the shadows to take a place in his court. This was a perfect opportunity for the Kech Dhakaan and its Silent Clans. Two of these clans, the Kech Volaar and the Kech Shaarat have both revealed themselves to the Darguuls; but they have concealed their age, their power, and their resources. The Ghaal'dar know the Kech Volaar as an isolated clan of scholars with talented duur'kala. They know the Kech Shaarat as proud and deadly warriors. But the Ghaal'dar don't know that these clans have a direct tie to the ancient empire, that they possess powerful Dhakaani relics and daashor artificers, or that these clans are preparing to choose a new emperor of their own. Likewise, the Ghaal'dar don't know anything about the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand the fundamental differences between the modern goblins and the ancient dar. And because the Kech Dhakaan hide their true numbers and capabilities, the Ghaal'dar don't realize just how powerful these clans are; most of the Ghaal'dar tribes believe that the kech are small and somewhat backward, out of touch with modern life.

If the Darguuls know little about the Kech Dhakaan, the people of the Five Nations know even less. When traveling abroad, the Heirs of Dhakaan generally take advantage of the broad ignorance of goblin culture, allowing people to assume that they're Darguul mercenaries. They won't hide their names or distinctive equipment, but it's a rare human who recognizes Dhakaani designs. Generally, the only way someone knows details about the Kech Dhakaan is if they've had personal experience with them.

### What Defines the Dhakaani?

To understand the Dhakaani, one must know the factors that shape them--biological, cultural, and supernatural. Some of these factors apply to all goblinoids, while others were weakened or destroyed by the Kapaa'vola, and apply solely to the Kech Dhakaan. As with any race or culture, these are generalized traits, and any individual dar could stray radically from this foundation. But it's a place to begin when creating a Dhakaani player character or NPC.

#### Biology

At a glance, the goblinoid subspecies are as different from one another as humans and halflings. The subspecies can't interbreed and have different lifespans. But a primal connection binds the dar together, with scent, body language, and other subtle factors uniting them; at an instinctual level, they feel more comfortable around goblinoids than they do with other humanoids.

***Born Underground.*** Goblinoid civilization began in the caverns of Khyber, and the Kech Dhakaan have lived in subterranean vaults for countless generations. They are comfortable in close and barren environments, and may find vast open spaces to be disorienting.

***Living in Darkness.*** Tied to their subterranean origins, the dar are used to living by the dim light of luminescent fungi or with no light at all. While absolute darkness impairs their darkvision, it's still possible to see and operate under those conditions, and many goblin tunnels have no light whatsoever. As a result, the dar have no inherent fear of darkness. They generally prefer to be active in times of dim light when their night-blind enemies are disadvantaged but the goblins can see freely, and Dhakaani communities come alive as night falls.

***Lawfully Inclined.*** At a primal level, the dar seek structure and hierarchy. They prefer to work in groups and to have a clear plan of action, and tend toward lawful alignments. This doesn't mean that they feel any compulsion to follow the laws humans impose; rather, they are more inclined to work with others and to respect authority within their own communities. This basic instinct strengthens both the cultural drive of muut and the impact of the Uul Dhakaan.

***Inherently Rational.*** The minds of dar are inherently pragmatic and rational. They have trouble engaging with entirely abstract concepts or things that cannot be proven. They prefer history to fiction; while the duur'kala inspire troops with stories, these are tales of things that actually happened. As a result, divine spellcasters are rare among the dar, as they struggle with the transcendental faith required to channel divine magic. While this could be considered a cultural trait, it's tied to the underlying psyche of the dar; they take well to structure and discipline, but struggle with pure faith. The Kapaa'vola weakened this trait within the wider goblinoid population, and there are priests of the Sovereigns and Six among the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins, but even there, priests, paladins, and divine magic are less common than among humans and their kin.

***Body Language.*** The pointed ears of the dar are more flexible than human ears, and are an important part of the body language of the dar. Hobgoblins have especially expressive ears, and it's common for hobgoblin soldiers to use their ears to signal allies when silence is required, the same way a human soldier would use hand gestures. Two quick flicks of the ear is a common signal to allies to *be on guard*. Consider the ears of a dar in describing its mood.

#### Muut and Atcha

Dhakaani society revolves around the concepts of *muut* and *atcha*. Muut is typically translated as "duty," though it can also be seen as "the honor of the empire"--something everyone must work to maintain. Muut is what is expected of you, what you owe to your comrades. Dhakaani don't expect thanks for doing something that has to be done; rather, they are disgusted by those who shirk their responsibilities. The closest dar equivalent to "thank you" is *ta muut,* which simply means, "You do your duty."

By contrast, atcha refers to "personal honor" or "glory," an opportunity to exceed what is required of you. No dar is content to simply do what is expected; the quest for atcha is a powerful driving force that urges dar to chase their full potential. In battle, the exhortation *paatcha* means, "This is a chance to gain honor!"

The Ghaal'dar have adopted the concepts of muut and atcha, but merely as abstract concepts. For the dar, muut and atcha are the driving poles of daily life. Every dar *knows* muut; they know what is expected and what they owe to the empire. They feel a deep bond to their fellow dar, and know that in pursuing muut, they serve the common good. At the same time, they yearn to attain atcha--to exceed expectations, to do deeds that will be remembered by those who follow you. The deep role of muut and atcha is shaped both by childhood training, by daily life, and further by the Uul Dhakaan. So while Dhakaani have personal desires and ambitions, muut should always come first.

The Dhakaani idea of "honor in victory" is quite different from that of Dol Arrah and the people of the Five Nations. The Dhakaani prize victory and efficiency, both on and off the battlefield. Atcha comes from standing your ground against seemingly impossible odds and from displaying skill and discipline. There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire--but when possible, it's always better to kill for the empire. Muut demands that dar honor their debts and keep their promises; but ultimately, muut only binds dar to dar, and some feel no shame in lying to the chaat'oor who have stolen their lands and pillaged their tombs.

#### Dar United

The culture of the Kech Dhakaan is relentlessly martial. The Keepers are armies who have been keeping the dream of the empire alive for thousands of years. There is no place for indolence or waste among the Dhakaani; surviving countless generations in the deep vaults required strict discipline. The young are assigned roles based on their subspecies and their aptitudes, and progress is based on performance. Now that the Dhakaani have returned to the surface, resources are more plentiful and life is less austere. However, thousands of years of strict tradition remain in place.

Within the Kech Dhakaan, all of the dar subspecies are celebrated for their strengths and what they have to offer the empire. This is reinforced both by the principle of muut and by the Uul Dhakaan. While different subspecies fill different roles in their community, it's important to note that among the Dhakaani, *all* roles are respected. Among the surface-dwelling Darguuls, goblins are often oppressed and dismissed, forced into menial tasks--by contrast, the Dhakaani are grateful for the service of the golin'dar, whether they are skilled crafters or menial workers. The goblin who cleans the latrines is serving the demands of muut as fully as a formidable hobgoblin warlord. The ghaal'dar lead because they are natural leaders. The guul'dar use their strength for the greater good. These things are simply *understood*, and the ghaal'dar don't have to use force to enforce their rule.

Stemming from this sense of unity, dar avoid killing other dar whenever they can. The Kech Dhakaan have different views on the future course of the empire, and each kech hopes to fill the throne. But they recognize that they are few against a world, and can't afford to carelessly spill the blood of other dar. This principle doesn't apply to the modern goblinoids of Darguun, the "bugbears" and "hobgoblins." Physically, these creatures are dar, but they don't know the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand muut as the dar do. The leaders of the Kech Shaarat believe that while it may be possible to use the Darguuls, ultimately, they are not dar and must be treated as enemies. Some of the Kech Volaar are searching for a way to reconcile to these lost kin, expanding the Uul Dhakaan, undoing the damage of the Kapaa'vola and restoring its victims to the fold. Others among the Volaar argue that coexistence should be considered, that the isolationism of the empire must be reconsidered in the face of the widespread, powerful nations of the modern age. But compromise has never been a virtue of the Dhakaani, and what happens next will depend on the Emperor Yet to Come.

While the principle of muut calls for individual sacrifice for the good of the empire, the dar generally have no great empathy for other species, and they are willing to take harsh action to secure the prosperity of their people. The Dhakaani don't subjugate other species--but not because of compassion. Rather, they consider it inefficient to try to force their values and traditions on creatures who have no concept of muut and who don't share the Uul Dhakaan. Thus, Dhakaani tradition has always been to drive enemies out of their territories, or if such exile is impossible, to kill them. They are fine with coexistence--as long as the enemy exists over there, and as long as the dar don't need more land.

#### Clan Before Family

Family lines are of minimal importance among the Keepers. Rank must be earned, not inherited from a parent, and family names are only used within a clan. In a formal situation, the full clan name is used with no article ("Dhaaka of Kech Volaar"). Leaders often use the surname Dhakaan as a way of indicating that the empire itself is their family; thus, Tuura Dhakaan of Kech Volaar and Ruus Dhakaan of Kech Shaarat aren't actually related, it's a formal affectation.

Depending on their purpose in the wider world, it's common for dar to use a "traveling name" among *gath'dar*--a general term for non-Dhakaani, without the pejorative tone of chaat'oor. The Kech Volaar and Kech Shaarat have both revealed their presence (though while posing as Darguul clans) and their names are used freely; other clans may or may not choose to operate openly.

#### Fashion and Art

The dar are soldiers. Most wear common uniforms, which have diverged slightly across clans, but the core designs are similar. Dhakaani uniforms and armor are durable and functional, designed to be worn comfortably for extended periods. Officers often sport hornlike protrusions on their helmets or shoulder plates that indicate rank. Many dar also wear an armored mask that covers the lower face; for lower-ranking soldiers, the design of the mask is usually tied to the clan, while for officers, it may evoke an honored ancestor or an imposing beast.

Many dar make use of tattoos or scarification. Kech symbols are a common marking, but some--notably the Kech Volaar--take this further, with an ongoing series of tattoos that reflect the bearer's life and accomplishments.

Dhakaani art, like the rest of their culture, is practical and functional. Dar aren't fond of abstraction, and their art is primarily instructional (depicting an ideal to strive toward) or commemorative (preserving the deeds of heroes). Dar art can be realistic--faithfully representing historical figures--or symbolic--depicting Dhaakani ideals in simple and iconic ways.

Dar clothing and art is generally designed to be viewed in dark subterranean tunnels, where darkvision conveys color in shades of gray. As a result, color combinations can seem quite odd to human eyes, but this is because they aren't chosen for their color, but for how they appear in the dark.

#### Cuisine

The Kech Dhakaan began as armies, and further had limited resources in the deep vaults; as a result, their food focuses on practical nutrition, and waste is unacceptable. Dhakaani cuisine is simple, hearty, and very portable once prepared. Food tends to be thick and chewy, with sour and bitter flavors central to the dar palate, and strong spices sometimes used to mask undesirable tastes. On the surface, a grain known as *noon* is a primary source of sustenance. In the subterranean vaults, a fungus called *suur* fills this role. Surface-dwelling dar enjoy lizards and snakes--sources of both eggs and meat--while in the depths, blind cave fish and insects are common sources of protein.

Suur and noon are usually eaten in the form of starchy balls. Other Dhakaani meals are typically boiled or steamed in flavored liquids, such as eggs boiled in broth. In addition to being used for seasoning, pickling is a crucial form of preservation. Dehydrated meats, especially chewy lizard and fish jerky, are also common staples.

While sweet foods are rare within the kech, the golin'dar have a noted sweet tooth. Traveling goblins often indulge in sweets and desserts while traveling with gath'dar. However, dar are often lactose intolerant, and as a result, might avoid many gath'dar foods.

#### Traditions and Equipment

Dhakaani daashor are the finest weaponsmiths on Khorvaire, their skill at metallurgy outstripping even House Cannith. Their traditions blend mundane skill and transmutation to create and manipulate remarkable alloys, including adamantine, mithral, and byeshk, and Dhakaani champions often wield weapons forged from such material. Dhakaani equipment is designed for durability and efficiency, rarely gaudy or bejeweled. Likewise, armor is tough and flexible--often with the properties of *mithral* or *adamantine armor*--but not dramatic in style.

Dhakaani magic items are either created by the daashor (who specialize in armor and weapons) or by gifted duur'kala. Dhakaani magic rarely focuses on evocation effects, and they have no tradition of elemental binding. While the Dhakaani lack the wide-scale production capacity of House Cannith, they've had thousands of years to build supplies. Elite units are often equipped with uncommon magic items, such as *adamantine armor*, *cloaks of protection*, *gauntlets of ogre power*, and *vola'khesh* (described in chapter 7). Shaarat'khesh assassins may use *hats of disguise*, *bags of holding*, or *cloaks of elvenkind*--though not by that name!--and sometimes more powerful weapons, such as *daggers of venom* or *Keeper's fangs* (also in chapter 7). So while the Dhakaani dar are relatively few in number compared to the people of the Five Nations, they're not only disciplined and highly skilled, but also well equipped.

When the empire was at its height, the daashor and duur'kala could create grand artifacts and eldritch machines, such as *Ghaal'duur* and the *grieving tree* presented in chapter 7. The creation of such artifacts was never trivial, and relied on remarkable talents, knowledge lost during the daelkyr incursion, and the use of rare substances and planar conjunctions. As such, while it's possible for the Dhakaani to create new artifacts, they are primarily concerned with recovering and reclaiming ancient treasures forged in the past. The Kech Dhakaan are deeply concerned about how many of their treasures have been claimed by chaat'oor, and react with anger toward other species carrying Dhakaani relics.

### The Kech Dhakaan

As the Kapaa'vola spread and the Empire of Dhakaan quickly unraveled, many of its greatest leaders sealed their followers in deep vaults. Each of these units took responsibility for preserving one of the pillars of the empire. Together, they called themselves the *Kech Dhakaan*--the Keepers of the Empire. The name of each individual clan was given based on their chosen ideal; thus the Kech Volaar are Keepers of the Word, and the Kech Shaarat are Keepers of the Sword. Uul'kala helped to coordinate this effort and to maintain communication between the isolated vaults over time, but there are kech vaults that never had uul'kala, and others who lost their uul'kala over time.

Chapter 4 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* includes general information about the Heirs of Dhakaan, campaign hooks, and possible NPCs. This section expands on the clans named in that chapter, including descriptions of some Keeper clans that are known or active. This isn't intended to be a complete list, and DMs should feel free to add additional kech--whether they have been in communication with the others or have been in isolation--or to remove kech from this list if they don't fit the story of a campaign.

Of these clans, both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar have made their presence known in Darguun. But while the Darguuls have heard of these clans, they don't fully understand their origins. The other clans are currently obscure and mysterious, though dramatic action could quickly bring them fame--or infamy.

#### The Ketch Draal: "Keepers of the City"

While the Dhakaani are renowned for their weaponcraft, it may be surpassed by their skill with fortifications and civic engineering. Many of the greatest cities of the Five Nations are built on Dhakaani foundations, and ruins of other Dhakaani fortresses still linger after many thousands of years. These techniques are the treasure guarded by the Kech Draal, and Draal daashor specialize in the transmutation effects and the shaping of earth and stone. Every kech has its architects, just as the Draal have their soldiers and their duur'kala--but stonework and mining are the pride of the Kech Draal.

The Kech Draal have little interest in filling the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come. While they look forward to building the next empire, they have no interest in competing with the other Keepers; they seek only the realization of the dream. They have not yet made their presence felt in the world, and it is up to the DM where their deep vault lies. It's possible that they are beneath Wroat or Korth, secretly dwelling below the deepest foundations of a modern capital.

The golin'dar play a more central role in the Kech Draal than in many clans. While the clan is formally led by the dirge singer Kuula Dhakaan and the warlord Druun Dhakaan, the ghaal'dar consult with a golin'dar council on all major decisions. The golin'dar Taala is the senior voice on this council, respected for her wisdom and skill.

The neutrality of the Kech Draal can make them a good choice for a Dhakaani character, as they can find a welcome with any of the Keepers. A Draal character might be gathering information about the world, seeking lost treasure, or even just eager to survey the styles of architecture that have developed over the past millennia.

#### The Kech Ghaalrac: "Clan of Heroes"

When the kech sages identified the threat posed by the Kapaa'vola, some chose retreat--hiding in the deep vaults and waiting for the curse to pass. One of their leaders, Khaas Dhakaan, had no interest in hiding. Gathering the greatest heroes of the age--Dhakaani champions, Khesh'dar assassins, Gatekeeper orcs--Khaas led his army into the depths of Khyber, and into the demiplane that served as the prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Khaas swore to end the Treacherous Whisper and to recover artifacts stolen by Dyrrn and its minions--artifacts that Khaas believed could restore the splintering empire.

Khaas and his champions were never heard from again, neither in the waking world or in the Uul Dhakaan, and it was assumed that they were lost. In truth, they were trapped within Dyrrn's demiplane, fighting an endless struggle against the minions of the daelkyr. Time moves strangely in Dyrrn's realm, and by the reckoning of the Ghaalrac, it has been less than three centuries since they set out on their mission. Trapped in a realm of madness, the Ghaalrac have blended Dhakaani and Gatekeeper techniques with the symbionts of the daelkyr, with results that others might find horrifying. They have crafted powerful living weapons and artifacts, along with magebred champions with unnatural powers--armored bugbears with the regenerative abilities of trolls, goblin assassins with the ability to slip through space. They have found ways to bind aberrations to their will, and have forced beholders and grells to serve them.

The descendants of the Gatekeeper orcs that ventured into Khyber with the Kech Ghaalrac remain to this day, having found their own place in the clan's caste system as specialists in druidic magic. However, the traditions carried by these onceGatekeepers vary greatly from their surface counterparts, in part because they've been cut off from the natural world. While still driven by the goal of fighting aberrations, after hundreds of years in an alien land, the orcs of the Kech Ghaalrac would seem similarly alien to other Gatekeepers.

Now, after centuries of struggle in Khyber, the Kech Ghaalrac have returned. The current leader--who also uses the name Khaas--possesses what the Ghaalrac call *Ur'taash*, the "First Crown." It's said that this was the final creation of Jhazaal Dhakaan, forged to unite the empire; it protects his mind, allows him to communicate with Ghaalrac squads across great distances, and possesses powerful coercive abilities. Khaas claims to have torn this crown from Dyrrn's grip as he dealt a mortal blow to the Corruptor. He believes that it is the Ghaalrac who broke the power of the Treacherous Whisper, and that only they can restore the Empire of Dhakaan.

Khaas and the other leaders of the Kech Ghaalrac carry the names of heroes of ancient Dhakaan: Torrm of the Gatekeepers, the master assassin known only as Khesh, the mighty guul'dar Korrga. The original heroes are long dead, but these dar claim to be their descendants and carry their ancient weapons. They possess tremendous power, and they intend to use it. But there are many questions about the Kech Ghaalrac. Are they truly what they claim to be, or have they been corrupted by Dyrrn and turned into tools of the daelkyr, whether they realize it or not? They aren't part of the Uul Dhakaan as experienced by the other Keepers, but they have their own version of the dream that sustained them through the long war, and believe that it is the other clans who have lost sight of the dream. The other Keepers will know nothing of the Kech Ghaalrac until the Clan of Heroes reveals itself; will they support Khaas Dhakaan of their own volition, or be compelled by the power of *Ur'taash*? Or will the Heirs of Dhakaan oppose these transformed heroes?

The Kech Ghaalrac can appear anywhere that suits the needs of the campaign. When they appear, it should be dramatic. One option is for them to seize the Gathering Stone, House Deneith's fortress in Darguun; this strikes a dramatic blow against chaat'oor and gives the Ghaalrac an opportunity to bend Darguuls to their will. Khaas Dhakaan believes that dar and Darguul alike are all flawed--but that all can be redeemed by the power of Ur'taash.

The Kech Ghaalrac is an unlikely origin for a player character; their story works best when people don't know if they have been corrupted or are righteous, despite their unnatural tools and techniques. However, a Dhakaani character from another kech could be determined to uncover the truth about the Kech Ghaalrac. Or a character could be the distant descendant of one of the Ghaalrac heroes, seeking to learn the final fate of their ancestor and to recover a prized relic from the Ghaalrac champion who carries it.

#### The Kech Hashraac: "The Keepers of Thunder"

Siege warfare and combat engineering are the specialties of the Kech Hashraac. The Dhakaani don't employ siege staffs or evokers, and the Hashraac has spent generations developing new weapons to dominate the battlefield. If the DM wishes to add the conventional firearms and cannons presented in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to a campaign, the Kech Hashraac could have developed these weapons during their long isolation. Alternatively, the Hashraac could specialize in the enhanced artillery described in chapter 1, alchemical explosives, or an entirely new form of weapon.

The Kech Hashraac have yet to reveal their presence to the world at large. While few in number, the force they command could be vital in any conflict that lies ahead. Will they support another kech claiming the imperial throne, or will they pursue it themselves? The warlord Duul Hashraac leads the clan; he is noteworthy both for being a daashor as opposed to a common warrior, and for using his clan name instead of "Dhakaan" as his sobriquet. Duul is proud of what his people have achieved; whether he seeks the throne or serves as kingmaker, he believes the Kech Hashraac hold the keys to Dhakaani victory.

The Kech Hashraac are a logical choice for a Dhakaani Artillerist artificer; the artificer's magic can be tied to the tools the DM chooses to provide to these Keepers. A Hashraac player character could be dispatched to study the battle magic of the Five Nations, to seek out rare components needed for new weapons, or to investigate the Mournland and the theory that the Mourning was caused by battle magic. Alternatively, a Hashraac artificer could have left the clan to pursue their own unorthodox weapons research, hoping to return in triumph once they have perfected their techniques.

#### The Kech Nasaar: "Keepers of Night"

Long ago, interaction with the Aereni line of Vol led to the dirge singer Iraala becoming the first dar vampire. She shared this gift with her lover, the warlord Muurat. In the centuries that passed, the two were placed in charge of the covert operations of the empire. Spying and assassination remained the domain of the Khesh'dar, but the Kech Nasaar served both as internal security and as commandos specializing in guerilla tactics and psychological warfare. It was the Kech Nasaar who first recognized the threat of the Kapaa'vola, and set the Keeper seclusion in motion.

Over their long seclusion, the Kech Nasaar have continued to study unconventional paths of warfare. Nasaar duur'kala often train in the techniques of the bardic College of Whispers, while elite soldiers of the Kech Nasaar might be Gloom Stalker rangers. Under the leadership of Iraala and Muurat, the Nasaar have also explored the arts of necromancy, though it's up to the DM to decide just how far they've continued down this path. Do they have squads of vampire commandos? Have they developed entirely new forms of undead? Given their penchant for psychological warfare, Nasaar agents could sow terror and confusion by raising the bones of soldiers who died in the Last War, making it seem like the vengeful dead yearned to continue the battle. Or perhaps the Nasaar have developed techniques allowing them to seize control of undead raised by other necromancers--a technique that could cause untold chaos in Karrnath.

Iraala and Muurat continue to lead the clan, giving a direct tie to the ancient empire. The edict of a long-dead emperor asserted that no dead creature could wear the imperial crown; while the services of the Nasaar were valued, the dead are severed from the Uul Dhakaan and cannot draw on the wisdom of the past or see Jhazaal's dream. The Nasaar could have fallen into true darkness in their isolation, and now seek to seize power for themselves. On the other hand, despite being cut off from the Uul Dhakaan, Iraala and Muurat remember the actual glory of the fallen empire, and could be the truest devotees of the concepts of muut and atcha, placing the needs of the empire above their personal ambitions. As in ancient times, they might seek to guide the living emperor, and to ensure the Dhakaani Empire follows the proper course.

A player character from the Kech Nasaar could follow unusual paths. A Nasaar dar might be gathering information for the clan, or they could be tasked to monitor the activities of the other Keepers, especially the Kech Ghaalrac and Kech Shaarat. Iraala may have hidden artifacts across Khorvaire before the fall; a Nasaar character could seek to recover these in her service, or could have gone rogue to pursue one of these treasures.

#### The Kech Ruuska: "Keepers of the Tiger"

Beasts served many important roles in the Empire of Dhakaan. The Ruuska dar fill much the same role that House Vadalis does for the Five Nations: tending and training the many beasts of the empire, while always searching for--or creating--new beasts to fill a need. *Ruuska* is the Goblin word for "tiger," and tigers and dire tigers are often used as cavalry in the vanguard of Dhakaani armies. But the Kech Ruuska breed all manner of beasts, from fierce guardians to clever messengers and simple livestock.

Just as there are soldiers in every kech, there are tenders in every vault who maintain the beasts of that vault. However, the Kech Ruuska specialize in breeding and training them, producing the finest Beast Master rangers, and keeping the widest range of exotic creatures in their arsenals. The Ruuska also work with magebreeding and may have produced entirely new beasts or monstrosities previously unknown on the surface. While the Ruuska don't have a spiritual bond to the natural world, they might have developed a form of druid--a Moon druid serving as a specialist in assuming animal forms and controlling beasts. The Ruuska have also experimented with lycanthropy. It's up to the DM to decide if they were able to control and weaponize the curse, if their efforts ultimately came to nothing, or if lycanthropy has spread throughout the Ruuska--a secret they are concealing from the other clans.

The Kech Ruuska are led by the Beast Master warlord Lhaar Dhakaan and the duur'kala Oruul. The Kech Shaarat are putting considerable pressure on the Ruuska to support their claim to the crown. It remains to be seen if Lhaar bows to these threats, or whether the Ruuska seek an alliance that lets them turn the tables on the powerful Shaarat.

The Kech Ruuska are a good option for a Dhakaani ranger. The clan can also be an interesting way to add new or exotic beasts or monstrosities into the world, and could be an intriguing foil for a storyline involving House Vadalis.

#### The Kech Shaarat: "Keepers of the Sword"

The Kech Shaarat are the largest of the Keeper clans. Founded by the Warlord of the South in the final days of the empire, the Shaarat possess an artifact known as Skai Shaarat--the Great Blade--a sword handed down from warlord to warlord since the days of the Six Kings. While they lack the exotic specialties of the other clans, the Kech Shaarat excel at war. The deep vault of the Kech Shaarat is tied to a demiplane in Khyber known as the Ironlands. This provided them with access to resources and space denied to the other clans, including the byeshk ore the Dhakaani prize for their weapons (as presented in chapter 7), while also keeping them on a constant war footing. Of all the Keepers, the Kech Shaarat have the finest Forge Adept artificers (a new specialization presented in chapter 6), as well as talented Battle Smiths--though the Dhakaani don't generally employ constructs, these artificers have created innovative steel defenders. On the other hand, the Kech Shaarat have not emphasized the role of the duur'kala as much as other clans, and have a weaker bardic tradition.

The Kech Shaarat have emerged into the open and are the most active of the Dhakaani tribes. The warlord Ruus Dhakaan (no relation to the Kech Ruuska, though his name does mean "Tiger") has reclaimed several ancient Dhakaani fortresses in the Seawall Mountains, and is working to refortify these ruins. In the course of this expansion, the Kech Shaarat have already absorbed a lesser clan--the Kech Nozhii, who maintained the treasury of the empire--which has expanded their resources. They are actively pressuring the Kech Ruuska to submit to an alliance acknowledging Ruus as the Emperor Yet to Come, and Shaarat warriors have a bitter rivalry with the Kech Volaar.

Ruus has sent representatives to Rhukaan Draal and pledged to support Lhesh Haruuc, but this is a ruse designed to bide time and to take the measure of an enemy. Ruus hasn't revealed the true nature of his people or the full scale of his forces to the Ghaal'dar, and most Darguuls believe the Kech Shaarat are a Ghaal'dar clan with strange traditions. House Deneith is keen to gain the services of these mysterious warriors, but Ruus Dhakaan refuses to have any dealings with the chaat'oor. Ruus Dhakaan is a brilliant strategist and charismatic leader. He earned *Skai Shaarat* with his courage and skill, and should never be underestimated. While he's determined to claim the imperial throne, he's also concerned with muut and the good of the empire; he will pressure other Keepers to support his claim, but won't butcher his own kind. However, he's ruthless when it comes to dealing with chaat'oor, and doubts whether the modern "goblins" can be redeemed. They may be close enough to dar that they could be worthy servants, but he's considering whether it's simpler to slaughter the Darguuls once the dar are united.

The Kech Shaarat are the most aggressive of the clans, and this is an interesting option for an entire party of dar adventurers. A lone Shaarat dar could be an exile from the clan or a spy evaluating the strengths and fighting styles of the chaat'oor. One option is for a Shaarat player character to have challenged Ruus and been defeated; now they seek an ancient artifact that would allow them to face Ruus again and claim leadership over the clan.

#### The Kech Uul: "Keepers of the Dream"

The Kech Uul are a small clan. Their vault is a fortified monastery hidden deep in Khyber. This is the seat of the chot'uul, the monks who watch over the Uul Dhakaan and protect the dreams of the empire. This clan also has the largest number of uul'kala bards, and knows the most about how to produce dream keys and dreambound objects.

The Kech Uul have yet to return to the surface of Khorvaire. Its people spend much of their time within the Uul Dhakaan itself, using drugs and meditation to enter the dream even while waking. The monks of the Kech Uul are devoted to protecting the dream from outside influences, but they're also experts in navigating the dream itself; if a Dhakaani dreamer is searching for a particular memory or wishes to speak with the dreamvestige of an ancient hero, a Kech Uul monk can be an invaluable guide. Likewise, the uul'kala of the Dream Keepers are the backbone of long-distance communication between clans; the uul'kala maintain message stations at various points within the dream, and can pass a message from one dreamer to another.

There are several ways that the Kech Uul could fit into a campaign. They can serve as a neutral resource supporting all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance through the dream. However, it could be that they're not what they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect Jhazaal's dream from outside influences, but it's possible the clan has been partially or fully replaced by quori imposters, who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the ends of the Dreaming Dark. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was destroyed long ago by the daelkyr or another threat; the Dream Keepers continue to serve their function, but they're actually long dead, and the chot'uul encountered in the Uul are simply dream-vestiges, memories lingering in Dal Quor.

The name of the Kech Uul's current leader is unknown outside the clan. Uul dar often wear masks or veils; they do not seek atcha, and desire only to help others achieve Jhazaal's dream.

A player character tied to the Uul dar could be an uul'kala, a bard (likely of the College of Glamour) pursuing a dream-vision or searching for dream-related artifacts. An exotic possibility is that the character believes it's possible to bring other species into the Uul Dhakaan, allowing for a peaceful union; if this is the case, is this goal supported by the clan elders, or is the character an eccentric renegade? Alternatively, any dar character could have a mentor from the Uul dar, who visits them in their dreams offering guidance and inspiration.

#### The Kech Volaar: "Keepers of the Word"

The Kech Volaar believe that knowledge is power. Their deep vault holds scrolls and tablets recording thousands of years of imperial history. While they have strong warriors and a proud martial tradition, the Volaar value the song over the blade and have the strongest duur'kala of any clan.

While the Volaar weaponsmiths aren't a match for those of the Kech Shaarat, the clan leaders recognize the value of arcane magic over pure mundane might. The Volaar have long worked to push the limits of duur'kala magic, and to master the techniques that created wonders such as the Uul Dhakaan and the greatest artifacts of the old empire. The Volaar have experimented with warlocks--working with supernatural patrons under carefully controlled conditions--and sought to cultivate sorcerers when they have appeared among the dar populace. Since their return to the surface, the Kech Volaar are working both to recover the greatest artifacts and treasures of the empire, and to study the arcane techniques of the modern gath'dar. Where the Kech Shaarat believe that Dhakaani might can sweep aside any enemy, the Volaar recognize the arcane power wielded by the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and are doing everything they can to study and master this unfamiliar science.

Perhaps because of this, the Kech Volaar are also the most conciliatory of the Keeper clans. They are the most willing to interact with the gath'dar, both because they recognize the need to understand these possible enemies, and in the hopes that some form of coexistence may be possible. Like the Kech Uul, Volaar leader Tuura Dhakaan wonders if the Uul Dhakaan can expand to incorporate other creatures--if the empire can unite gath'dar as it does the dar.

Despite these hopes, the Kech Volaar are devoted to the dar above all else. They are the Keepers of History, and they know the sacrifices their ancestors had to make and the bitter wars against the chaat'or and the *taarn* (elves). They are wise and willing to seek all paths to prosperity, but will never surrender the dream of the eternal empire.

Tuura Dhakaan has revealed herself to the world, and has sent representatives to the court of Lhesh Haruuc. Like the Kech Shaarat, the Volaar have concealed their true history and power. Volaar duur'kala often travel among the Ghaal'dar sharing stories, helping to educate them about their glorious past and the traditions of muut and atcha; this ties to Tuura's hopes that the "goblins" can be redeemed and drawn back to their past glory. Tuura is determined to claim the throne of the Emperor Yet to Come; she hopes to find the strength needed to compel the Kech Shaarat through reclaiming powerful artifacts and building allies.

The Kech Volaar are one of the most active Dhakaani clans. Adventurers could encounter Volaar reclaimers across Khorvaire as they search for Dhakaani relics. A Volaar wizard or artificer could be struggling to master the techniques of the gath'dar, while a duur'kala could be an envoy sent to recover an ancient treasure or to seek allies among the outsiders.

#### The Khesh'dar

Under Dhakaani tradition, the golin'dar--goblins--are traditionally laborers and artisans. While the guul'dar and ghaal'dar train for war, the golin'dar maintain the hearth. But there is a force that stands outside this tradition, lurking in the shadows of the Dhakaani Empire. These are the *Khesh'dar*--the Silent Folk--golin'dar who use their speed and cunning as spies, scouts, and assassins.

While the Khesh'dar are part of the Uul Dhakaan, they have always remained separate from its traditions. They have always served the emperor and their warlords, but they do so in their own time. Their refuges have always been hidden, even before the Kapaa'vola. The ascetic Khesh'dar aren't compelled by money or power; they choose when to offer aid, and set a fair price on their services. The Khesh'dar take no sides in disputes between clans, and they do not seek to rule; in the present day they serve both the Kech Shaarat and the Kech Volaar. However, they don't accept missions that they see as threatening the empire itself; as a result, they rarely accept a charge to kill a warlord or a duur'kala.

Because of this long tradition of secrecy, even the warlords of the Kech Dhakaan don't know where the vaults of the Khesh'dar are located, or just how many of the Silent Folk are out there. Goblins are spread throughout Khorvaire and most of the great cities of the Five Nations have significant goblin populations, and this provides an easy opportunity for the Khesh'dar to move freely throughout the modern world without drawing attention. The Khesh'dar have been active throughout the last century, spying on the chaat'oor and building up resources and safe houses across the Five Nations. They've recruited many eyes among the modern city goblins and the goblins of Darguun, though these contacts rarely understand exactly who they are dealing with. The Khesh'dar likewise have spies and agents among the golin'dar of every Keeper clan, ensuring that there are few secrets hidden from the Silent Folk.

The Khesh'dar are split into two primary traditions. The Taarka'khesh ("Silent Wolves") are swift scouts, experts in wilderness reconnaissance and targeted strikes. The Taarka'khesh typically rely on worg cavalry; many develop an unusual primal bond with their worg companions, and the golin'dar view the worgs as partners, not beasts. Though worgs don't have an innate tie to the Uul Dhakaan, the Beast Master rangers of the Taarka'khesh can summon their worg companions to them while dreaming.

The second Khesh'dar tradition is that of the Shaarat'khesh ("Silent Blades"), spies and assassins trained to operate within cities. Both usually operate covertly, disguised to blend in with the local goblin population. However, each order has a distinctive half-mask that is worn over the lower face during formal interactions.

It's up to the DM to decide just how widespread the Khesh'dar are. They may have a single deep vault and only a few hundred operatives, or it could be that they are the largest of the Dhakaani clans, with outposts hidden across Khorvaire. They may have been building networks for thousands of years, simply waiting for the Keepers to rise before putting these resources to use. But are they truly content to serve any emperor? Or do the Khesh'dar have a hidden agenda of their own? Is it possible that they're tied to the Lords of Dust... or even to the dragons of the Chamber?

The Khesh'dar could serve as an espionage agency patron for a group of golin'dar adventurers. More likely, a single character could be an undercover operative of the Khesh'dar, either pursuing a deep, long-term mission or simply gathering intelligence while waiting for specific orders. It's not unusual for the Khesh'dar to seek to cultivate useful allies among the gath'dar. It would be unusual for one of the Khesh'dar to explain their traditions to an outsider, but it's not impossible that a Khesh'dar could form a bond to a gath'dar comrade over the course of their adventures.

#### Dhakaani NPCs

Members of the Kech Dhakaan can be found across the world, seeking information, relics, and pursuing the goals of their people. They can be deadly foes--or unexpected allies against a common foe. While most of the characters on the Dhakaani NPCs table aren't spies, they won't volunteer information about their people or background unless they come to know and trust someone; generally, they allow others to believe that they're from an obscure Darguun clan.

### The Emperor Yet to Come

For the Kech Dhakaan emerging from their vaults, the modern world is a waking nightmare. Modern goblinoids are hollow mockeries of the true dar. Foul chaat'oor hold the lands of the empire and pillage the treasures of the People. But the dar still have their dream. They know what the world should be, and know that together, somehow, they can defy the chaat'oor and restore the eternal empire. However, a long path lies ahead. The dar are badly outnumbered, and can't take on all of the Five Nations in open combat. They don't yet understand the enemy or know what they're capable of. The Kech Volaar, in particular, realize the power of the wide magic of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and recognize they need to know more. There's also the question of whether there's any hope for the modern goblinoids. Can they be instilled with Dhakaani values? Or are they no better than chaat'oor?

Only a new emperor can make this decision. But the last emperor was lost to the Kapaa'vola before the Kech Dhakaan descended into the depths, and no single kech has the power to create a new emperor. The duur'kala speak of the Emperor Yet To Come, with the belief that once all the Keepers rise, a single emperor will somehow win universal acclaim, uniting them all against the chaat'oor. But whether they be lhesh, duur'kala, or daashor, it's unclear what will bring this to pass.

The Kech Uul believe that when a single dar has the support of the majority, the Uul Dhakaan will reveal them--that the emperor will be proclaimed and crowned within the universal dream. But even if true, what will trigger this? The Kech Shaarat believe that power will determine the emperor. They have already absorbed the Kech Nozhii and are pressuring the Kech Ruuska, using a combination of force and fear to convince the smaller clans that the path to victory lies through uniting under a single clan. The Kech Shaarat would prefer not to kill other dar, but Ruus Dhakaan is willing to take steps to prove his power and right to lead, and Shaarat and Volaar agents have clashed in the field.

Tuura Dhakaan of the Kech Volaar is following a different path as she pursues the crown. She seeks to recover lost artifacts, reminding the dar of their glory while also amassing powerful tools. There are a few she is especially keen to find: *Ur'taash*, the First Crown; *Guulen*, the Rod of Kings; and *Ghaal'duur*, the horn of Jhazaal Dhakaan. *Ur'taash* is currently in the possession of the Khesh Ghaalrac, though its authenticity is in question. The whereabouts of *Guulen* and *Ghaal'duur* remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the Kech Shaarat remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the Kech Volaar believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.

Other Keepers may devise their own paths to winning allies or the throne, and there may be Keeper clans that have yet to be revealed. For now, the Kech Dhakaan are focused on gathering information and competing among themselves. Once they unite behind a single leader, they'll have to decide how to deal with the Darguuls, the dragonmarked houses, and the Five Nations.

### Playing Dhakaani Characters

There are a few factors to consider when creating a dar character. This section examines questions about the story--What's your clan? What's your background? In addition, chapter 6 presents three new racial options for Dhakaani player characters, along with two new class archetypes associated with the Dhakaani: the Forge Adept artificer specialist, and the bardic College of the Dirge Singer.

#### Starting at 1st Level

The Dhakaani are among the most effective and elite forces on Khorvaire. They possess excellent training and techniques, exceptional discipline, and masterful equipment. If you're in a campaign where characters are starting at a higher level, this isn't an issue. But what if you're starting at level 1? Dhakaani fighters are often Battle Master or Samurai fighters in *adamantine armor*, but you don't gain your archetype until you've been adventuring outside your kech for several levels. Here are four ideas of how to explain the inconsistency:

- **Disorientation.** You don't have your traditional equipment, and it takes you a little time to get used to working with this inferior gear. You're not used to working with chaat'oor; they don't respond to your obvious cues, and their behavior constantly confuses you. The wide sky above is extremely disorienting, as you've spent much of your life underground. And worst of all is the *smell*. It's going to take you a few adventures to get your groove back.
- **Injury.** You've suffered a significant physical or psychological injury and it's going to take you a while to recover. Frankly, after everything you've been through, it's impressive that you're even capable of functioning as well as you do. Is it a mundane injury, or something more exotic? Maybe you were possessed by a quori for a few years and you're still reclaiming your identity. Or perhaps you were struck by shards of an exploding dragonshard; once you're fully recovered, might those same slivers explain some of your unusual class abilities?
- **Working Undercover.** Most clans don't want the world to know their full history and capabilities. You would rather be mistaken for a Darguul or city goblin, and are keeping a low profile. You don't have *adamantine armor* because it would raise questions, and you intentionally conceal your full capabilities until you trust your fellow adventurers enough to reveal your true talents.
- **Personal Growth.** All of your training up to this point has set you on this path; your past life experience readied you for the new skills you're learning today. You underwent endless training while in your kech, but the pieces didn't click into place until you spent time fighting in the field. One month of adventuring didn't trump a decade of intense training, but it helped to trigger it.

Ultimately, this is all about creating a story to carry you through your first few adventures. It doesn't have to be a flawless explanation, just use your imagination and keep adventuring; soon, you'll reach level 3!

#### Clan and Purpose

The dar went into hiding thousands of years ago to avoid the Kapaa'vola. They have only recently emerged from those deep vaults and reclaimed fortresses on the surface. As a dar character, you were surely born in one of the deep vaults and indoctrinated into the traditions of your clan. Consider the following questions about your character's origins:

- **Which clan are you tied to?** Are you one of the Kech Volaar, or are you a hermit from the Kech Uul? Consider the list of clans from the previous section and see which works best for the story you want to tell.
- **What was your role within your clan?** The Dhakaani are armies, working with limited resources and absolute focus. Everyone had a function to perform, likely reflected by your background and your class. What training did you receive, and what was the purpose of that training? Were you a soldier? Were you being prepared for a military specialty (possibly reflected by your choice of archetype)? If you're a bard, were you trained to inspire troops on the battlefield or were you primarily a diplomatic envoy? You wouldn't have been pushed into a role unless you showed an aptitude for it--but did you like the role you were given, or was it a path you had to follow?
- **Why have you left your clan?** Despite the demands of muut and the shaping influence of the Uul Dhakaan, every dar is a unique individual with their own passions and drives. Ultimately, what do you most care about? Do you believe in the dream of the Dhakaani Empire? Do you want to become the next emperor, or do you simply want to help your people thrive? Have you rejected the bond of muut and turned your back on the empire? Or are you seeking atcha and chasing a personal story--a quest for vengeance against the defiling chaat'oor, or completing the ancient vow of an ancestor? The Dhakaani Departures table suggests some reasons a dar might leave their clan.

#### Background

Your clan and character motivations often suggest a logical choice for your background. However, certain background features don't make much sense for a Dhakaani character. Soldier is a logical background for a dar fighter, but your Military Rank feature is unrecognized outside your clan. Likewise, it makes sense for a golin'dar from the Kech Draal to have the skills of a guild artisan, but you don't have membership in any guild known in the Five Nations.

Your background can be used to reflect your current mission as opposed to your basic training. If you're operating undercover, you might have been taught the skills of a charlatan and set up with a solid False Identity, even if you're a plainspoken soldier at heart. As a Shaarat'khesh monk, the urchin background can reflect your training and familiarity with cities, even though you were never an abandoned child. As one of the Kech Uul, the hermit background could represent your long isolation in Jhazaal's dream--and your Discovery could be a revelation you found in the dream, whether it concerns the future of the empire or something of even greater import.

Chapter 6 includes two variant background features for use with Dhakaani characters of any background. In addition, the Dhakaani Trinkets table below suggests simple items that your character might carry from their past; your DM might let you select one of these as your trinket, or to substitute it for another small item from your background equipment. What's its story? Why do you carry it today?

#### Class

Some classes and archetypes are common among Dhakaani dar, while others aren't as likely. Here are some suggestions of interesting characters you might play for each class.

***Artificer.*** The Kech Dhakaan call their artificers daashor. The talent of artifice is rare, and some of the greatest secrets of the past were lost to the Kapaa'vola. Dhakaani artificers typically focus on the creation of arms and armor, taking the Forge Adept archetype, provided in chapter 6, or the Battle Smith archetype. Artillerist artificers are generally only found in the Kech Hashraac. The Kech Volaar are actively seeking to unlock the arcane traditions of the Five Nations and the dragonmarked houses, and a Volaar artificer could follow any archetype with the idea that you are blazing new trails through your work. While the most legendary daashor were male ghaal'dar, there are no gender or race restrictions for this role, and golin'dar often show a talent for artifice.

***Barbarian.*** It's unusual for ghaal'dar to follow the path of the barbarian, and unheard of for golin'dar. However, the guul'dar--bugbears--are taught that their strength is the strength of the empire, and guul'dar warriors typically serve as the terrifying vanguard of a Dhakaani army. This path can be represented by the barbarian, but with an important story difference--guul'dar barbarians aren't savages, and they don't surrender to unthinking rage. Instead, guul'dar "rage" is a cultivated surge of adrenaline and combat awareness, not unlike the Fighting Spirit of the Samurai fighter. The Path of the Totem Warrior is the common choice for guul'dar barbarians; the choice of totem doesn't reflect a primal spirit, but rather specialized combat training. If your DM approves of this concept, you might even be able to replace the 10th-level Spirit Walker feature with the Intimidating Presence of the Berserker barbarian, as it's difficult to explain how commune with nature is tied to your military training.

***Bard.*** Bards play a central role in Dhakaani culture, serving as spiritual leaders and taking the role that priests fill in many other cultures. However, Dhakaani bards inspire and guide the people using tales of the past and the dream of the future, as opposed to priests seeking the favor of divine forces. Bards are also found as diplomats, civic leaders, and healers, and are the primary spellcasters in Dhakaani society. The most common bards are the *duur'kala* (dirge singers); as a duur'kala, you'll likely want to follow the College of the Dirge Singer included in chapter 6, or perhaps the College of Lore. The duur'kala of the Kech Nasaar may choose the College of Whispers, while the uul'kala dream singers may follow the College of Glamour. Most clans have a strongly ingrained tradition that only female ghaal'dar can serve as duur'kala. However, player characters are exceptional, and it's always possible to defy this tradition.

***Fighter.*** The Dhakaani are a martial culture, and this is their greatest strength. Dhakaani combat techniques have been honed over thousands of years, blended with the natural instincts and exceptional discipline of the Dhakaani soldier. Both the Champion and Battle Master archetypes are appropriate for all Dhakaani fighters. The Samurai archetype is primarily found with the Kech Shaarat, and is a ghaal'dar variation of the guul'dar barbarian technique. Cavaliers are tied to the tiger cavalry, and are especially common in the Kech Ruuska. Within most clans, fighter training is reserved for male ghaal'dar. However, player characters can certainly challenge this stereotype.

***Monk.*** Monks are rare among the Kech Dhakaan, but not unknown. The most widespread monastic tradition is the *shaarat'dor* (literally, "No Sword") technique of the Khesh'dar. Practitioners can focus on the physical art by following the Way of the Open Hand, or they can blend this with the Shaarat'khesh arts of stealth by choosing the Way of Shadow. The Khesh'dar are exclusively golin'dar, but an exceptional character of another race might be taken in by the Silent Folk. The other established monastic tradition is that of the chot'uul (Dream Watchers). Most of the chot'uul blend mental and martial discipline, and typically follow the Kensei path. Others learn how to manipulate reality as one might shape a dream; these chot'uul might follow the Way of the Four Elements. Most chot'uul are part of the reclusive Kech Uul, but most kech vaults have a small, dedicated group of dream guardians.

***Ranger.*** The golin'dar of the Taarka'khesh are legendary scouts and skirmishers, the most common rangers among the Dhakaani. However, guul'dar and ghaal'dar may also train as skirmishers. Typically, the cavalry are Beast Master rangers, working with worgs or tigers. Skirmishers are often Hunters or Gloom Stalkers.

***Rogue.*** Typically, the Kech Dhakaan face their foes in open combat. The arts of the rogue are the domain of the Khesh'dar goblins, who operate in the shadows of the empire. While the Shaarat'khesh are best known for their assassins, specialists can be found following almost any archetype. The Silent Folk train and can dispatch Thieves when necessary. Arcane Tricksters have adapted a form of the duur'kala's magic. And if you're using *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, Inquisitive rogues are the top spies of the Khesh'dar, while a handful of Masterminds serve as expert strategists. It's entirely possible to run a campaign around a team of Shaarat'khesh rogues with different specialties, with the Khesh'dar serving as an espionage patron. Outside of the Khesh'dar, the Kech Nasaar are the only clan that regularly trains ghaal'dar spies and assassins.

***Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard.*** At the height of the Empire of Dhakaan, the only common spellcasters were artificers and bards. Focused on martial discipline, the Dhakaani never unlocked the secrets of wizardry or embraced eldritch bargains--but today, the Kech Volaar are actively trying to bridge this gap in their arsenal. As a Volaar wizard, you can follow any path; the key is that you are likely a trailblazer and your accomplishments and discoveries may be very important to your people. There is no established tradition of sorcery among the Dhakaani, but the Volaar are likewise seeking out any dar who show signs of sorcerous potential. The clan has even been experimenting with warlocks, actively seeking out arcane patrons and attempted controlled studies. So as a Volaar warlock, you might be the first dar to work with this particular patron, and your superiors are eager to see how it turns out.

There are a few other options for arcane spellcasters. Depending on the path the DM decides to take with the Kech Hashraac, they could be training Evokers; like the Volaar wizards, this would reflect cutting-edge research. The Kech Nasaar have been studying necromancy for a long time and may have developed Necromancer wizards. The Nasaar are more willing than most to dally with sinister powers, and it's likewise possible that they've had a tradition of warlocks.

***Cleric, Druid, Paladin.*** The general mindset of the dar is ill-suited to the abstract concept of faith, whether in higher powers or the world itself. They believe in the past. They believe in their leaders. But they don't believe that there are cosmic powers or prophecies that control fate. It is possible to play a Dhakaani paladin who draws their divine power from their absolute devotion to the empire, or a cleric who channels power from the Uul Dhakaan. But this was always intended as an intentional gap in the capabilities of the Dhakaani: they have far greater martial skill than most of the cultures of Khorvaire, but they simply don't have access to divine magic.

#### Race

Chapter 6 presents new racial traits for Dhakaani goblinoids. If you're playing a dar, your racial traits are determined by whether you're a golin'dar (goblin), ghaal'dar (hobgoblin), or guul'dar (bugbear). The terms goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear are part of the Common tongue, introduced by human settlers. While most modern goblinoids have adopted these terms themselves, the dar maintain the old ways.

*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* provided racial traits for goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, but those represent the modern goblinoids, denizens of Darguun and Droaam whose ancestors were touched by the Kapaa'vola of Dyrrn the Corruptor. While the goblinoids of the Kech Dhakaan--the *dar*--are physically identical to their modern cousins, there are some important differences. The dar are bound together both by the philosophy of muut and atcha and by the spiritual connection of the Uul Dhakaan. Their lives are shaped by a relentless martial culture and a rigid caste system. As one of the dar, you know your place in society and have undergone intense training to hone your natural strengths. The racial traits in chapter 6 reflect that training, but if you were raised outside of Dhakaani society, you should instead use the standard goblinoid traits.

## The Mror Holds

![Artist: Julio Azevedo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/112%20julio%20azevedo.png)

>>Tol kollan! Some say our ancestors came from a place of ice, but we all know that's nonsense. Our ancestors were the mountains themselves. The dragons were jealous of their mighty stature, so they cast a spell that put them all to sleep, and that's where the mountains come from. We dwarves? We're the sweat from their brow. Don't believe me? Go take a look at the Face of Mror! No one could carve something like that, my friend; that's the mountain's original face. As for the others, well, they just went to sleep face down. That's the tale I had from my father, and you wouldn't want to call him a liar!
>>

Despite their long lives, the Mror dwarves are surprisingly unconcerned with recording the past. They care deeply about family. They cling to property, whether it's land or more portable possessions. They're fierce in protecting the things that they care about. But as the bard Kessler said, "The Mror care deeply about their stories, but facts just get in the way." Mror talespinners have an endless supply of stories about the mighty deeds of clan heroes, but when it comes to specific dates or verifiable facts, things often get muddy. Records of debts, marriages, adoptions--these things are written down by Sivis scribes. But general history is largely trusted to the passed-down tales of the spinners, and they make history *interesting*. A particular story could be placed in three different centuries by three different clans, and the villain of one tale could be the hero in the neighboring holdfast.

### Mror History

Dwarves aren't native to Khorvaire, but no one knows exactly how or when they arrived. Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that's enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization--or ruins of it--waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there's no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.

#### Sol Udar: The Realm Below

Wherever the dwarves came from, they sunk their roots into the soil of Khorvaire. Dhakaani dirge singers sing of battles between dwarf and dar that took place in vast halls below the earth. Dhakaani records--which are more accurate than those of the dwarves--show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn't worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call *Sol Udar*, the Realm Below.

#### Mallanok: The Exile

The next major era in Mror history was *Mallanok*, the Exile. At some point--whether years or centuries later is unclear--a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn't decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known.

#### Dul Krok: Bloody Stones

The Exile was followed by *Dul Krok*, Bloody Stones. When humanity came to Khorvaire, the Ironroot Mountains were divided between thirteen powerful clans of dwarves. These mountain dwarves were proud and warlike, but they were mired in feuds--and these ancient conflicts kept them from substantially advancing their culture or their influence in the world. Even as humans spread across the land, the dwarves continued to devote their energy and resources to their own ongoing vendettas. While they were unquestionably fierce warriors and made fine weapons, their deep division prevented any progress. The Ironroot dwarves weren't the only dwarves on Khorvaire; some had spread east into what's now the Lhazaar Principalities. It was largely these Lhazaar dwarves who integrated with humanity, spreading west with them, though there were also a few Mror who left their feuds behind to help build the foundations of the new kingdoms.

#### Bal Dulor: The Great Sorrow

As the Five Nations took form, humanity largely shunned the Ironroot Mountains and left the dwarves to their feuding. Following the rise of the united kingdom of Galifar, Prince Karrn finally made a concerted effort to pacify the mountain dwarves. This time is known as *Bal Dulor*, the Great Sorrow. The soldiers of Galifar were disciplined and took advantage of the existing feuds, isolating the clans or pitting them against one another. The central fortresses of the holds were impregnable, but Galifar held the surrounding lands; the compromise that followed left the dwarves as lords of their territories, but as subjects of Galifar, forced to pay tribute and taxes.

> ##### Ironroot or Hoarfrost?
>
>The Mror Holds occupy the mountainous region that separates Karrnath from the Lhazaar Principalities. The Mror dwarves occupy this entire region, and they call it *tra Mroreln*, the Iron Roots. When humans first came to Khorvaire and settled the Lhazaar Principalities, they called the foreboding range to the west the Hoarfrost Mountains.
>
>Today, the Mror and most others refer to the entire region as the Ironroot Mountains. However, the people of the Lhazaar Principalities still call them the Hoarfrost, and some people use this term to refer to the mountains east of Mirror Lake.
>

#### Korran Hal: Korran's Blessing

While the Great Sorrow was a source of deep shame to the dwarves, it brought a forced end to their violent feuds and forced them to raise the funds to pay their tribute. Warriors became miners, and the Ironroot Mountains proved to be an astonishingly rich source of mineral wealth. Mror talespinners say that the Sovereign Onatar had his forge in the mountains, and that Kol Korran kept his hoard beneath it; other scholars have speculated that there could be a more unsavory supernatural force at work, an overlord tied to greed bound beneath the peaks. Whatever the truth, this led to the period known as *Korran Hal*, Korran's Blessing. Even with the taxes owed to Galifar, the Mror prospered and built a thriving society. While the ancient feuds were never forgotten, violence was no longer their first answer. The bearers of the Dragonmark of Warding, Clan Kundarak, were drawn into the Twelve and became House Kundarak. Working closely with House Sivis, Kundarak parleyed its wealth and the power of its dragonmark to establish the Banking Guild, and the influence of Kundarak helped to drive a further wave of cultural advancement.

#### Tra Halor: the Revelation

As the dwarves expanded their mines and fortress holds, they'd occasionally find tunnels and outposts that seemed to be tied to Sol Udar--outposts that appeared to have been abandoned many thousands of years ago. The dwarves continued to dig deeper toward the Realm Below, and this led to a wave of breakthroughs in the early tenth century, an event broadly known as *tra Halor*, the Revelation. Miners and masons found evidence of a vast, wondrous subterranean empire, with enormous city-halls below all of the modern holds. Early explorers found finely crafted treasures, along with evidence of even deeper mines and fortresses. It was clear that these cities had been built by dwarves, and it speaks to Mror character that rather than pondering the fate of the builders of this abandoned realm, the dwarves simply embraced this as a miraculous stroke of fortune and proof of their collective destiny.

#### Mror Solu: The Realms of Iron

By this time, the Last War was underway. For the last decade, Karrnath had been steadily raising taxes and demanding troop levies. But the dwarves were conquered long ago by *Galifar*, whereas Karrnath was just a piece of that broken kingdom. Inspired by Sol Udar and recognizing how far their people had come since the Great Sorrow, the lords of the holds convened in *Mror Aulan*, the Iron Council. The lords of the Iron Council affirmed their union and declared the sovereignty of *Mror Solu*--the Realms of Iron--a name which even the Mror themselves usually translate into Common as the Mror Holds. It's worth noting that in calling themselves the Mror, dwarves aren't professing fealty to Clan Mroranon or the ancient king of Sol Udar; rather, they're simply calling themselves "the Ironfolk."

#### Dol Udar: The War Below

The time that followed was initially known as *Aul Aur*, the Age of Gold. While Karrnath engaged in retaliatory actions during the Last War, it was struggling with famine and against its neighbors, and lacked the power to stop the rebellion. The dwarves expanded and explored Sol Udar, reclaiming wondrous relics and facilities. But soon they learned what had become of the ancient dwarves of the Realm Below, and why the kingdom had never reached up to the exiles. The ancient dwarves had been wiped out thousands of years ago by the daelkyr, for Sol Udar abutted on the demiplane prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor, one of the mightiest of the daelkyr. The first explorers found curious tools formed from flesh and bone--and then they discovered the creatures that made them. Dolgrim hordes rose from the depths. Entire colonies were lost and consumed by illithid corruption. While the Five Nations fought the Last War, the Mror fell into *Dol Udar*, the War Below, discussed in more detail later in "The Realm Below" section.

Today, the Mror Holds are in a stalemate against the aberrations below, and remain balanced between the Age of Gold and the War Below. Even with their current holdings, the dwarves continue to draw vast wealth from their mines. Clans take pride in the treasures reclaimed from the depths, and Mror artificers continue to learn from studying ancient artifacts. Though the dwarves are few in number, their economic power and strong fortifications have deterred any Karrnathi retribution, and no one challenged their recognition under the Treaty of Thronehold. The dwarves are proud and prosperous--and yet, old feuds linger. The Realm Below remains both a glorious lure and a deadly threat. And tensions are further exacerbated by the other treasures recovered from the depths--tools made not by dwarves, but by the daelkyr.

### What Defines the Mror?

Dwarves aren't human. In creating a Mror character, it can help to reflect on the ways dwarves differ from humans. Clan plays a significant role in Mror culture; especially in the wake of rediscovering the Realm Below, a Mroranon dwarf is quite different from a Soldorak dwarf. But there are a few common things that can be borne in mind for any Mror character.

#### Biology

While the dwarves of the Realm Below may have spent their entire lives below the surface, the Mror dwarves were born on the surface of the Ironroot Mountains. Mror dwarves appreciate sunlight and color, and their buildings typically have windows, but dwarves don't need light. Absolute darkness impairs their darkvision, but this is merely inconvenient, not unbearable, and many mine tunnels and stretches of the Realm Below have no light sources.

Resulting from this, the circadian rhythms of dwarves are more flexible than those of humans. While it's important to maintain a regular schedule, day and night have little meaning for the Mror. Mror communities are active at all hours, and major Mror businesses are continuously open. "Nightlife" isn't a concept in Mror society, and entertainment can likewise be found at all hours, so traveling Mror are often frustrated by the limited opportunities in human communities.

#### The War Below

Characters from the Five Nations are shaped by the Last War, and similarly, Mror are shaped by Dol Udar, the War Below. Currently, this conflict is simmering, but there has been no victory and the threat remains. When the war was at its height, all Mror lived in daily fear of aberrant attacks and society's resources were devoted to the war effort. The Mror Holds are smaller than the Five Nations, and the impact of the conflict was intense. All civilians engaged in combat drills in preparation for dolgrim assault, and everyone was expected to contribute to the war effort--repairing or producing arms and armor, maintaining fortifications, or fighting. For the Mror, this is the source of the Weapon Training and Tool Proficiency racial features. For example, if you are proficient in brewer's tools, you may have been involved in creating supplies for the soldiers.

In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider how the war affected you and how this is reflected by your class and proficiencies. A few questions to consider...

- Did you fight on the front lines, battling aberrations in the depths? If so, what's the most terrifying thing you saw in the conflict? Are you scarred by your experiences, or does nothing scare you anymore?
- If you didn't fight in the Realm Below, did you serve on any civilian support brigades? Did you spend your childhood sharpening axes and repairing armor? Were you kept out of the conflict by family connections, or did you refuse to serve?
- Who or what did you lose to the conflict? Did you have a stake in a colony or mine that had to be abandoned? Do you have a sibling or lover lost in the depths--and if so, are you sure that they're dead, or could they be prisoners of Dyrrn?
- Do you dream of delving deeper into the depths, or would you rather see the Realm Below sealed away forever?

#### Family First

The Mror Holds are a feudal society, comprised of holds, spires, and families. There are twelve active holds, each governed by a ruling clan, which gives its name to the hold--so Droranathhold is ruled by Clan Droranath. Each hold is then broken up into smaller territories known as spires, each ruled by a clan; there are ancient ties of kinship and marriage between clans and the ruling clan. Within a spire, families maintain tenant relationships with the local clan. Land is held by a clan or family, and most businesses are family businesses. Families are long established, and the creation of a new family is an extremely rare event.

The Mror engage with their history through stories, and clans and families are the characters in those stories. Typically, a Mror tale refers to heroes and villains solely by their family names. So in *Mroranon and the Troll King*, it doesn't matter exactly when the story took place or which specific Mroranon it was; it's a story about *Mroranon*. In one tale, he is a heroic youth, and in another, she is a battle-scarred veteran, and yet they're depicted as the same Mroranon. And in both cases, all Mroranon dwarves should strive to live up to that example. Where the Tairnadal elves seek to emulate specific ancestors, Mror dwarves view their family as a greater whole. Your family is a direct extension of your identity; it's only natural that you'd help a family member in need, and betraying a family member is like stabbing yourself in the hand. This drives feuds and alliances; if you're wronged by a Hronnath dwarf, the blame lies with Clan Hronnath, not simply the individual. To draw another comparison to the elves, the Aereni preserve their ancestors as deathless undead. In contrast, the Mror don't feel that need to preserve individuals; you preserve your family by living up to its character and by adding to its story. The Mror also aren't as particular about precisely following the traditions of ancestors, as shown by the clans that are embracing symbionts; what you do is less important than how you do it, the values you stand for, and the lines you refuse to cross.

This doesn't mean that Mror don't take personal responsibility for their actions or feel pride in their personal deeds. The deeds of living dwarves are generally acknowledged by name, but when they take their place in history, their names are unlikely to be remembered. Instead, every dwarf hopes that their grand deeds will be added to the trove of stories told of their family--and that they won't shame their family with the memories of their misdeeds.

In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider your family. Are you part of a clan or ruling clan? If so, are you close enough to power to take the noble background, or are you a lesser heir? Are you from a tenant family, and if so, what is your family's business? Even more crucial, what is your family's *character*? When people tell stories about your family, what are the virtues they highlight? Are there any particular things your family is known for, any celebrated deeds you might emulate, or anything a member of your family should never do? Some families have specific taboos; a Tronnan must never break their word, while a Holladon never turns away a guest. Does your family have any such traditions?

Also consider how your family was affected by the Dol Udar. Did they invest deeply in the depths, only to suffer grievous losses when the horrors rose? Did they fight on the front lines, or largely remain above? Do they have a family treasure recovered from the Realm Below--a legendary item or artifact you might someday have the honor to wield? Are they willing to embrace symbionts, or are they disgusted by the tools of the daelkyr?

Finally, what is your standing with your family? If it's good, consider why you left the Mror Holds; chapter 1 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* includes a table with suggestions for this. If your standing is bad, what happened? Is it a situation you hope to fix, or have you turned your back on your family? As a player, talk to your DM about the role your family might play in a campaign; do you want to have cousins showing up in need of assistance or to be drawn into new feuds, or would you rather your family remain in your backstory?

#### Long Life and Treasured Stories

The Mror attitude toward family is one example of how they deal with their long lives. A dwarf can live to be up to 350 years old; intellectually, they mature at about the same rate as humans, but they generally aren't considered to be full adults until around 50 years of age. This ties to the fact that dwarves have a low fertility rate and their reproductive peak is between 50 and 120. While under 50, a Mror dwarf is usually learning the family trade and working directly for their parents, uncles, or aunts; at 50 and above, a dwarf starts thinking about starting their own branch of the family tree and the family trade.

In stark contrast to the elves of Aerenal, the Mror dwarves deal with their long lives by largely ignoring the passage of time: they intentionally don't record every detail or remember every person, instead simply holding on to the best moments and ideas. To them, the story matters more than the concrete facts. Individuals come and go, but the family remains, and the story continues. And the Mror deeply love stories. Like the dar, they prefer stories to be based on fact as opposed to being absolute fiction--but to the Mror, a story should always be entertaining, and as long as the spirit is true, it's fine to exaggerate the details. So while the talespinner bard serves as a keeper of history, their role as entertainers is as important--if not more so--than their role as sage.

Mror dwarves can be seen as boastful by outsiders, quick to share tales of their exploits. However, they don't seek to dominate every conversation with their tales, but expect others to share their stories as well--and if others don't, Mror are quick to boast about the deeds of their companions. Anyone who spends much time around Mror quickly grows used to the phrase *Tol kollan*--or the Common translation, "That reminds me of a story." Mror hate quick meetings; any gathering should have time for tales. In playing a Mror character, you might come up with a few stories you love, as well as taking joy in dramatically retelling the story of your adventures--the deeds of both you and your fellow adventurers--celebrating and highlighting your finest moments.

> ##### Mror Families and the Dragonmarked Houses
>
>Most Mror businesses are family businesses passed down over generations. However, families can and do adapt to deal with changing circumstances. In particular, the arrival of the dragonmarked houses forced many families to change their paths or to find a way to work with the houses. The Jolnar family of Toldrathhold had been healers for generations, but they couldn't match the healing capabilities of House Jorasco. Over time, the Jolnar shifted their focus to cultivating medicinal herbs and other supplies needed by Jorasco. They are still devoted to the health of others, but they've found a way to work with Jorasco instead of directly challenging it.
>
>In short, Mror families are more flexible than the Tairnadal or Aereni. They are willing to change their specific traditions or techniques to adapt to changing times; what matters is remaining true to the core values of the family.
>

#### Grand Gifts and Storied Treasures

The Mror are known for their love of objects--their love of *treasure*. In part, this ties to a deep appreciation of quality work. The dwarves appreciate beautiful things, but durability and functionality are far more important--as shown by the willingness of many dwarves to embrace grotesque symbionts. However, the dwarves are not greedy hoarders; while there are certain families known for their thrift, generosity is an important virtue to the Mror. As much as they value their treasures, there's joy in giving the perfect gift--showing that you can afford to give away a treasure, and that you recognize someone who will appreciate it and make good use of it. A common tradition at a grand feast is for each of the greatest heroes present--typically, the scions of ruling clans--to offer a gift to the host along with a tale of how they came by the gift; the one who gives the finest gift is served first at the feast.

While you may not have many feasts, consider this tradition when you have time and opportunity. Is there a chance to give a comrade a perfect gift? Is there a treasure you possess that might be better suited to one of your companions?

The Mror are deeply interested in objects with stories of their own. Every family has their own family treasures. Sometimes these are the most powerful magic items the dwarves have acquired, notably the case with artifacts and legendary items that have been recovered from the Realm Below over the last century; part of the pride of the ruling clans is derived from the treasures they can boast of. But a family treasure can also be a mundane item that has been a part of many epic stories. As noted earlier, no one cares which specific Mroranon heir was the hero of *Mroranon and the Troll King*. But if the house still has the bracer that hero made from the troll king's nose ring, carrying this relic is a tremendous source of pride. As a Mror adventurer, when you find treasures, you want to know the stories they already carrying--who forged this flame tongue shortsword and what battles has it seen? Also consider the items you possess that you feel a strong attachment to--how are their stories evolving along with yours?

#### Fashion

Clothes tell a story, and Mror dwarves love to tell tales with them--of clan and family, faith, and personality. As with most Mror possessions, the quality of clothing comes first. Because of this, dwarves from lesser families may only have a single set of clothing, but these are durable and well made. Though their basic outfits may be few, Mror place great stock in accessories, and a Mror outfit typically has elements that can be reversed, shifted, or removed. Brooches have important cultural significance, and can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, the symbol of a Sovereign whose favor is sought, or even moods; some brooches mean "leave me alone" or "looking for company." Other forms of jewelry--rings, chains, bracelets--are commonly worn by dwarves of both genders; this is an opportunity to show wealth, but decorative ornaments of iron are also worn by common folk. The *dultar*--blood blade--is a dagger worn both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance; each of the ruling clans has a distinct style of dultar. Any Mror dwarf can immediately identify another dwarf's clan from their dultar; for an outsider to recognize one, it requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (History) check.

Many Mror clans favor a martial aspect to their attire, especially in the wake of Dol Udar. However, not everyone wants to wear heavy steel all day, and the Mror generally use light alloys and thin layers of metal to craft their armor. Many Mror wear decorative armor that uses the statistics of light armor, but evokes the general flavor of a heavier breastplate--though anyone proficient in medium or heavy armor immediately recognizes the decorative nature of it.

Facial hair is common among the Mror, but styles vary by clan and family. Some families prefer neatly trimmed beards. Many clans weave beads into beards, with the design of the bead invoking the favor of a Sovereign or honoring a clan. Hair dye is often used as a form of personal expression.

Clans that have embraced the use of symbionts--notably Soldorak, Toranath, and Narathun--have developed many exotic fashions over the last century. For such dwarves, wearing symbiont clothing or accessories is a sign of courage and power, much as a hunter might wear the hides of animals they've defeated. Living clothing typically has a texture similar to leather, though chitin plating or hornlike protrusions are possible. Patterns or colors may shift to reflect the mood of the wearer, and a living cloak may ripple or billow of its own accord. Living clothing is self-cleaning and mending, and feeds on the excretions (primarily sweat) of the host. Narathun currently has the finest artisan-breeders working with living clothing, and styles are constantly evolving

#### Cuisine

Mror dwarves have exceptional constitutions and are resistant to poison, and thanks to these traits, they enjoy cuisine that others might avoid. The dwarves live in high mountains and subterranean settlements; while some of their meats and vegetables are familiar to the people of the Five Nations, they also use a wide variety of mushrooms and moss. Red pudding is a form of peaceful ooze raised as livestock and used in a variety of dishes. Mror stew can sicken creatures with more delicate stomachs, but it's entirely harmless to any creature resistant to poison damage, and many stout halflings of the Talenta Plains enjoy Mror cuisine.

Alcohol is also a form of poison, and Mror spirits have to be exceptionally strong for sturdy dwarves to enjoy their mindaltering properties. Mror brewers often use mushrooms to produce alcohol, and also produce mushroom-based beverages with light hallucinogenic effects. The drinks of the Five Nations are extremely weak by Mror standards, and some consider the ability to brew personal supplies to be a basic survival tool when traveling in foreign lands. And when outsiders visit the Mror, their hosts are careful to keep these travelers from buying drinks that could kill them.

#### Religion

Mror talespinners maintain that the dwarves are the original chosen people of the Sovereigns, especially Kol Korran and Onatar. It's a curious coincidence that *kol* is the Dwarvish word for "commerce," while *dol* means "war," and the talespinners say the Traveler stole the names of the Sovereigns from the dwarves during the Exile. The priests of Krona Peak say that Kol Korran came to the hero Mroranon and promised the dwarves wealth if they remembered his name and followed his path, while the talespinners of Doldarunhold swear that the hero Doldarun was the son of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah. The records of the Library of Korranberg show that Zil missionaries were active in the Ironroots in the centuries before Bal Dulor, and some sages assert that these tales may have been the work of clever missionaries. Whatever the truth, the Mror already had shrines to the Sovereigns when young Karrn led his forces to conquer the holds.

While the Mror broadly acknowledge all of the Sovereigns, Kol Korran and Onatar are the most beloved; Boldrei and Olladra are also often invoked. Clan Doldarun, Mroranon, and Soranath are especially devout, while Droranath, Soldorak, and Toldorath are the most pragmatic. The Blood of Vol and the Dark Six have small followings in Narathun.

> ##### The Mror Dwarves and the Zil Gnomes

>While humanity largely ignored the Mror until after the foundation of Galifar, Zil explorers came to the mountains well before Bal Dulor. The characters of the Zil and Mror complement each other; the Zil are fascinated with abstract knowledge and love keeping records and accounting, while the Mror prefer story and emotion to dull fact. Resultingly, Zil scribes quickly became a standard feature in clan courts.

>As the Mror embraced banking and international business, this partnership grew. The Mror Holds and Zilargo are strong allies, and the alliance between House Kundarak and House Sivis is the strongest of the Twelve.

### The Realm Below

Each clan holds dominion over a spire, with the ruling clans laying claim to all remaining land within a hold. Critically, a clan holds domain both over its territory and all that lies below it. Early in the tenth century, miners in multiple holds broke through to the Realm Below. Wide tunnels shaped by elemental magic led to grand halls and subterranean cities crafted with techniques far beyond those of the modern Mror earthmovers. Avenues were lit by *continual flame*, and environmental enchantments ensured purity of air and comfortable climate. One might think the dwarves would have been more curious about the fate of the builders, but the ancient halls were entirely empty, with no signs of blood or bone. To those who discovered them, these empty halls were not foreboding, but a gift from the Sovereigns--a wondrous realm waiting for residents.

Clan leaders proceeded with caution, but were lured in as greater wonders were discovered. Ancient forges held the promise of forgotten techniques that could yet be reclaimed. Explorers returned with ornaments of gold and silver, found simply lying around the avenues for the taking. And there were mines--mines far safer and grander than those above, yet still containing riches. In time, explorers would realize that some of the richest mines were not entirely natural--that some shafts connect to demiplanes where the rules of reality don't always apply, like mines where emeralds grow like moss. This, too, could have been a warning, but the clan rulers were dazzled by wonder and opportunity. Expeditions moved into these upper levels, establishing colonies in the Realm Below. Miners began working the ancient veins, and smiths brought some of the forgotten foundries back online.

#### The War Below

For a time, it seemed like a golden age. No one knows exactly what brought it to an end. It may be the fault of adventurers and explorers who pressed too deep, ever searching for greater treasures. Or it could be that Dyrrn and its minions were watching the Mror expansion all along, waiting for the civilian population in the subterranean colonies to reach a critical level. At first, scouts brought back reports of newly exposed tunnels and chambers, of passages coated with unnatural fluids and strange things growing among mushroom gardens. Then the scouts stopped returning and the first wave of attacks began. Squads of dolgrims. Chokers lurking in the shadows. Soldorakhold faced howling mobs of derro--possibly the twisted survivors of Noldrunhold, the Lost Clan (described later in this chapter). Strange plagues and implacable oozes spread through the sunken colonies of Londurak. It was a time of terror, but also determination: whatever this unknown threat was, it must be held in the depths at any cost.

Armies were rallied, clans sending their finest soldiers into the depths, while every citizen trained with axe and hammer in preparation for dolgrim raids or a more dramatic surface assault. While some clans considered withdrawal, pride and a hunger for the wealth and wonders still hidden kept the dwarves fighting. They believed if they didn't hold them below, the aberrations would merely follow them to the surface. The years that followed were a time of endless terror and uncertainty. As the horrors were driven back in one hold, they would strike with redoubled force in another. New threats appeared with alarming regularity; dolgrims and derro were common foes, but there was no telling when a previously unknown danger would rise.

Two major discoveries shaped the second decade of the war. The first was the revelation of the enemy the Mror faced: the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. In 943 YK, the illithid Dyrrashar seized the colony below Loran's Gate in Soldorakhold, and broadcast a psychic message known as Dyrrn's Promise. This telepathic message didn't take the form of words, and attempts to transcribe it have produced widely varied translations. But the thrust was this: "You have drawn the gaze of the Overmind. You walk the Foul Labyrinth. Everything will change." Clan Soldorak eventually retook Loran's Gate and forced Dyrrashar to retreat, but the illithid general has risen elsewhere and remains at large today. None who experienced Dyrrn's Promise can ever forget it.

Even as Dyrrn's Promise spread fear, a second discovery brought hope. Following grave losses, Clan Londurak withdrew its forces to the surface. The Londurak prepared their defenses for a surface attack... but it never came. This pattern was repeated in other spires and holds; though the reasons are unclear, Dyrrn's forces won't pursue their enemies beyond Sol Udar.

#### Stalemate in the Depths

Nobody's sure why the aberrations avoid attacking the surface in force. Sages theorize it's tied to the wards that bind Dyrrn within its demiplane, and the aberrations only venture so far from the realm of their master. Or perhaps it's just a tactical choice. Regardless of the reason, the war has been in a stalemate over the last few years. But many sages believe that complacency is foolish, and until they know with absolute certainty what keeps Dyrrn's forces from rising to the surface, they can't know their protection will last. And even if the dolgrim hordes won't leave the tunnels and there's no threat of a large-scale assault, the Slithering Lord could be unfolding more subtle schemes.

Londurakhold and Tordannonhold have both pulled back from the war, fortifying all passages to the Realm Below and forbidding any traffic with the depths; they ignore the Realm Below, believing that if they don't poke the stirge's nest, the aberrations won't threaten them. Most of the other major clans maintain lines in the depths, defending claimed mines and colonies with steel and blood. These territories are secured by heavy fortifications, strong enough to repel attack, though serving on the line is a dangerous job. But the dwarves aren't trying to press beyond their current lines, for if they venture across it, their fate is unknown.

The future of the war remains unclear. Many of the clan lords yearn to press deeper. But there have been all too many casualties over the past few decades, and there is still considerable fear that the current lull is a trick--that Dyrrn is building forces for a renewed assault. And no one knows if there is a way to win the war once and for all, or if it's just a matter of advancing the line another hundred feet. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide whether the war remains as a lurking threat, or if it heats up and dominates the story.

#### Ripples on the Surface

While the aberrations have yet to come to the surface in force, the war is ongoing, and it can be felt on the surface. Individual aberrations occasionally come to the surface; a lone choker might carry out a spree of killings, or an illithid could rise to work with a dwarf cult. Psychic attacks, unnatural diseases, and other threats can emanate from the depths.

In the past three decades, the touch of Dyrrn has become seen even in the children born to the Mror dwarves. Very rarely, an infant born to ordinary parents is different. Known as ruinbound dwarves, these unusual infants are born with a personal symbiont bound to them, along with other unnerving mutations--and unexpected powers. Chapter 6 contains more information about ruinbound dwarves (and their reception amongst the Mror), along with a playable subrace.

The Influence of Dyrrn table gives examples of threats that could arise either in a subterranean colony or on the surface itself. These things aren't common, and clan soldiers are ever wary to repel threats, but these ideas could drive a story set in a Mror community.

It's important to recognize the scope of the conflict in the depths. No one knows the full size of the Realm Below, though it appears to stretch across the Ironroot Mountains, and connects to multiple demiplanes in Khyber. There's a good chance it exists below every major Mror city, but not every spire has broken through and made a connection to Sol Udar. When creating adventures in a Mror city, decide if there is an established passage to the Realm Below; if so, is it a simple passage, or is there a subterranean fortress or colony? In a spire with no known connection, a cult could be secretly digging to try to reach their aberrant masters. Or a clan could have opened a passage beneath its keep but lacked the courage to explore it--a job for adventurers.

#### Venturing Below

To an outsider, the idea of pressing into the Realms Below may seem like madness, but several factors drive the ongoing Mror presence in the depths. The first is a hunger for the wonders that lie below. The ancient dwarves possessed the ability to craft legendary objects and artifacts. They understood Khyber's systems of demiplanes in a way even the Dhakaani haven't mastered; many clan lords dream of bottomless mines or resources that can't be found in the natural world. Beyond the innate desire for these things, for the Mror, it's a matter of pride. Sol Udar is the work of their ancestors. The knowledge that it holds, the untold wealth, this is their birthright. It's a burning reminder that they could be more than they are now--they could be greater than the Five Nations or the Aereni. Additionally, many dwarves are driven by their desire to know the story--to understand who their ancestors were and what became of them.

If a player character is a Mror noble, the Realm Below can be a tempting opportunity for advancement. The clans hold all lands below their territory. If a noble with a stalwart band of allies can secure an outpost in Sol Udar and fortify against the forces of Dyrrn, they can claim it as their personal estate. This could be a remarkable keep for a party of adventurers--if they are powerful enough to maintain it! The Realm Below Story Hooks table contains some more ideas for why adventurers might delve into the Realm Below.

The lines between regions secured by the Mror and those held by Dyrrn's forces are clearly marked. As the aberrations generally don't come to the surface, there are places where the uppermost passage has simply been sealed with magic and steel. In other places where the dwarves have established colonies, the edge of the colony is heavily fortified and patrolled by soldiers, ever alert for some new attack. In most cases, soldiers won't prevent someone from proceeding into the depths--but anyone returning goes through careful scrutiny to ensure they haven't been infected by unnatural influences. And if an explorer has returned with treasures, it's considered polite to offer a gift to the guardians.

#### Into the Silent Halls

The Realm Below blends the civilization of Sol Udar with the alien touch of the daelkyr. The dwarves of Sol Udar were an advanced civilization employing arcane science beyond that currently possessed by the Five Nations. The halls were shaped by elemental magic--an improved form of the *move earth* spell--and reinforced to be stronger than any natural stone. Barring any alien influence, the air is renewed by magic and remarkably fresh; a permanent prestidigitation effect keeps these halls clean after thousands of years and untold conflicts. Ultimately, venturing into this environment can be somewhat eerie: though there may have been a brutal battle there just months ago, the halls are silent and pristine.

Widespread magic was a part of daily life in Sol Udar. Explorers might find a chamber where illusory music begins to play as soon as someone enters, or discover a theater still performing ancient entertainment. Many doors are sealed by *arcane locks*, and high-security areas may have self-restoring *glyphs of warding* or more sophisticated security. The people of Sol Udar weren't warlike by nature. Their halls contain great forges and foundries, but many of their wonders are utilitarian. An Udar kitchen has tools that replicate the heating, chilling, and flavoring effects of *prestidigitation*, and might have a builtin *alchemy jug* to dispense whatever liquids are needed. Of course, not all enchantments are automatically noticeable, and many effects require some form of command word or gesture to activate; modern colonists who have settled in the upper levels of Sol Udar are still struggling to understand the full capabilities of their new home.

The dwarves of Sol Udar also took advantage of the many demiplanes that lie within Khyber, identifying passages to them and building around them, just as the people of the surface build around manifest zones. A typical demiplane portal is clearly marked and heavily secured, of great potential value--and danger--as they can break the laws of the natural world. Demiplanes are entirely unpredictable in size, some no larger than a town, with others the size of Khorvaire itself. Within a demiplane, time might run differently. Gemstones could grow on trees. A demiplane can have its own sun, and provide vegetation and other resources that couldn't be found in any natural cave. But a demiplane could also hold strange curses, unnatural diseases, or deadly creatures--or in the case of Dyrrn's prison-realm, all three.

The Realm Below isn't one single contiguous community. It was an entire nation, one that stretched at least the length of the Ironroot Mountains. There are major cities, small outposts, and long passages connecting them. The Realm Below likely had some form of rapid transit: Teleportation circles? Something similar to the lightning rail? A system tied to demiplanes? Whatever this was, it has yet to be discovered, and may lie on the lower levels held by Dyrrn's minions. In creating a section of the Realm Below for an adventure, the DM should think about the purpose of this particular area. Was it an industrial center? A residential community? A hospital? A prison? If it contains a passage to a demiplane, the nature of the demiplane should relate to the function of the community; if it's a hospital, perhaps the local demiplane has alien vegetation that has remarkable medicinal properties. But what unknown threats could dwell in the demiplane--threats the ancient dwarves knew to avoid?

#### Denizens of the Deep

Dyrrn's minions have spread throughout the lower reaches of Sol Udar. Areas inhabited by aberrations are generally easy to spot. Often, organic matter covers the surfaces of the buildings. Explorers have encountered fleshlike coating, with tendrils of muscle spread out like spiderwebs; organic fluids that move along the walls, a harmless form of living ooze; floating, bioluminescent globes that could be neurons in a vast brain; and other, stranger things. There are strange smells and sounds. People often experience telepathic static, hearing thoughts of people around them or having flashes of alien imagery. Areas infested by the daelkyr may use any of the traps found in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, but in this realm, hazards are generally *alive*. A falling net is a web-like membrane secreted by the ceiling. Poison darts are chitinous stingers grown by the walls. These traps can still be evaded by the standard methods, though at the DM's discretion, unusual skills could also apply; perhaps an organic poison needle trap could be disarmed with a Dexterity (Medicine) check instead of using thieves' tools.

Dyrrn's specialty is corruption, both mental and physical. Thus it has created creatures like the dolgrims and dolgaunts--goblinoids physically transformed into monsters, the most prolific denizens of the dark--as well as the derro, who still bear some resemblance to the dwarves they once were, but whose minds have been altered.

Dolgaunts often command units of dolgrims, but dolgaunts can also be found acting alone or maintaining strange shrines. The statistics presented in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* represent the typical creature, but unique dols can have greater abilities. Dols are capable of acting with surprising discipline and precision, but their strategies are often unorthodox and enigmatic.

Derro aren't aberrations, but are believed to be dwarves twisted by Dyrrn's power. There may be derro whose roots go back to the ancient dwarves who built Sol Udar; however, the common assumption is that the derro are the descendants of the lost dwarves of Noldrunhold. Other derro could be more recent victims, created from Mror settlers captured in the Dol Udar. The derro are nomadic scavengers who remain in constant motion, roaming the deep tunnels of the Realm Below. They completely ignore Dyrrn's aberrations, and seem to be ignored in turn; one scout reported seeing a derro band walk through a dolgrim camp, without acknowledgment from either side. Some scholars believe that the derro can't perceive the aberrations, and that some believe themselves to be in a reality in which Sol Udar is still in its time of glory, and the derro are its lords. They don't appear to serve Dyrrn directly, but they definitely see all outsiders from above as enemies. A derro warlord calling himself Lord Mror has repeatedly attacked Mror colonies; however, it's unclear if this is a single powerful derro with followers across the realm, or if several derro savants use this title.

The daelkyr often hold the most important areas of an Udar site; as such, these dungeons contain both treasures created by the dwarves and the organic tools of the daelkyr. However, the purpose of areas claimed by Dyrrn's forces varies widely. In some cases, there's a clear logic to what these creatures are doing: dolgrims could have seized an ancient foundry and begun forging weapons. Explorers could find some sort of spawning pit where new aberrations are being produced. But the behavior of aberrations is often alien and inexplicable; a chamber could contain a giant, beating heart that serves no apparent purpose, or a pool of liquid that reflects another location. The inhabitants of the depths are unpredictable, and aberrations may not have the same biological needs as natural humanoids; for example, dolgrims don't need to work subterranean farms for food.

Some aberrations are permanently settled in a region, but others may spill out of portals to Dyrrn's domain, and others may be grown on the spot by the organic matter spread throughout infested regions, or created from the corpses of foolish explorers. A gibbering mouther may whisper with the voices of the dwarves who ventured into the depths last week.

While mind flayers can be found serving any daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is their creator. Sol Udar is thus a logical place to encounter mind flayers or any creatures associated with them: intellect devourers, ulitharids, neothelids, and the like. Bear in mind that these creatures may serve a very different role in Eberron than in other settings, as they are the creations of Dyrrn; a neothelid may be an intentional creation, as opposed to an accidental abomination. Elder brains are tools used as telepathic anchors, linking local mind flayers, while the elder brains are linked to Dyrrn itself. In general, mind flayers serve as Dyrrn's emissaries and lieutenants--directing lesser aberrations or humanoid cults, or engaged in inscrutable research. The most infamous mind flayer is Dyrrashar, the ulitharid who delivered Dyrrn's Promise. It has appeared multiple times since then, often leading subtle attacks against Udar colonies.

Most other threats are encountered in isolation, and almost any sort of aberration could be found in the darkness; you can also use unusual variations of aberrations or monstrosities, shifting the creature to fit your story. For example, beholders primarily serve Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes, but Dyrrn could have beholder servitors with beaks surrounded with tentacles, as opposed to toothy maws.

### The Spoils of War

>>A tool's a tool. I don't care if my axe is made of steel or bone; I care about its edge. Our people found gold and iron beneath the mountains. We seized that opportunity and we prospered. Now we've dug deeper, and found something new. You may see monsters and be broken by your terror--I see only opportunity, and I intend to take it.
>>
>>--Lord Halarak of Soldorakhold
>>

The first Mror dwarves to explore Sol Udar were amazed at the treasures they found. While there was no sign of the original inhabitants, their possessions remained. Early explorers found remarkable jewelry, intriguing artwork, and caskets of coins--but magic items were often the most valuable. Many of these are like those found in the Five Nations, with a focus on practicality--items such as the *alchemy jug*, *bag of holding*, or *decanter of endless water*. While similar items are produced in the Five Nations, the arcane techniques used are intriguing, and some items displayed superior qualities; one team of scouts found an alchemy keg that's bulkier than the standard jug, but can produce twice the amount of liquid each day--and the alcohol it produces is far more potent than that of a standard *alchemy jug*. The Sol Udar Trinkets table presents some interesting items, both magical and mundane, that might be found adventuring in the Realm Below.

Beyond the minor curiosities scattered throughout Sol Udar, there were far greater treasures--legendary magic items and artifacts, things that can't be created in the present day. Only a few of these wonders have been found, and these have become a source of immense pride for the clans that possess them. It's common for a clan to declare such items to be the work of their ancestors, though this is typically a talespinner's fancy. Little concrete scholarship has been done on most of these treasures, and despite the commonly accepted myth of the dwarven exile, there's no reason to think that the ancestors of the modern Mror were all distributed evenly around the mountains, their descendants just happening to have remained exactly above their ancestral homes. Nonetheless, these relics are seen as proof of the power and potential of a clan, and most clan leaders don't look kindly on outsiders questioning their stories. Surely even more powerful and precious artifacts remain to be found in the deeper layers of the Realm Below, but the Dol Udar has kept the Mror from claiming these wonders.

While battling aberrations and making expeditions into infested layers, the dwarves recovered another unusual treasure--symbionts, living tools crafted by the daelkyr. Chapter 7 presents eight new symbionts that might be found in the Realm Below. Many clans want nothing to do with these foul things; Doldarun dwarves always burn symbionts with the corpses of the creatures that carry them. But not all dwarves share this distaste. Some clans see symbionts as just another form of treasure from the depths. The Toldorath and Droranath dwarves have no fear of symbionts, and a warrior may carry a *hungry axe* (as described in chapter 7) without protest from their clan; but these clans haven't embraced symbionts beyond keeping the trophies taken from fallen enemies. Both Soldorak and Narathun have gone further; in addition to using salvaged symbionts, these clans have spent decades studying the science behind these items and creating their own symbionts. In some cases, they are replicating existing items, but Soldorak fleshcrafters have also created unique symbionts, integrating the principles of daelkyr magic with their own arcane traditions. Those clans that favor such tools call fleshcrafted items *dolaur*--spoils of war. On the other hand, those that despise them often call symbionts and those who use them *dularash*--foul blood--a term often used to refer to spoiled meat or corrupted bloodlines.

Many existing magic items can be reflavored as symbionts. A Soldorak artificer might create a *cloak of elvenkind*, but formed of leathery, living flesh that shifts in hue like a chameleon. A Narathun *rope of climbing* isn't rope at all, but a coiled tentacle that follows the commands of the creature holding it. The Soldorak have created *lighting bugs*--identical in function to *everbright lanterns*, but able to cling or detach to a surface on command. These bugs need to be fed a few drops of blood each day, and in communities that use these, the former lamplighters now walk the streets to feed the bugs from their own body.

Outsiders may be horrified by these living tools, but the motives of dwarves that use them are rational to many of their people. To many Mror, these items are trophies, concrete proof of Mror victories over the daelkyr: "If you took a magic axe from a fallen foe, you'd be a fool to throw it away. So what if it moans when it kills? It's a powerful weapon, and it's mine by right of conquest!" Many Mror also see carrying these tools as a sign of their courage, proudly demonstrating they aren't afraid to put on living armor. They may bask in the fear that their treasures instill in their enemies. In addition, both Soldorak and Narathun are ambitious clans, and leaders hope that by unlocking the secrets of fleshcrafting, they can increase the power of their clans.

Those clans that revile symbionts say that fleshcrafting is an abomination and an affront to Aureon and Onatar. The Narathun counter that Onatar is the master artisan and can work with any material; it is the doubters who insult Onatar by thinking his servants can't master this new medium. This argument has found supporters in Clan Soranath; while the Soranath dwarves don't fully embrace symbionts as the Soldorak and Narathun do, they are interested in the science of fleshcrafting and have been studying these techniques.

The clans that embrace these techniques say that there is no danger, that this is just another form of science, while Doldarun dwarves insist that there can be no traffic with the daelkyr without corruption. The DM will have to decide the truth--can Soldorak benefit from their exploration of fleshcrafting, or are their warlocks and artificers being corrupted by Dyrrn? Whatever the truth of it, tensions between those clans who embrace these tools and those who revile them continue to rise.

A character exploring the fleshcrafting techniques could be an artificer, describing their spellcasting as being tied to organic tools. Other arcane scholars who explore the techniques of the daelkyr become warlocks, typically using the Great Old One as their patron. In creating a Mror warlock, consider whether you're bargaining with Dyrrn itself--are you a cultist of the Dragon Below, willing to serve the daelkyr to gain power? Or have you gained your powers from studying the daelkyr and their methods, but instead of serving them, you're essentially stealing their techniques and hacking their systems? If you follow the latter path, you might not have a literal patron at all, or your "patron" could be a cabal of other dwarves studying the same techniques, and their requests help all of you learn more about fleshcrafting. Or if your DM is willing, perhaps you can even tap into the telepathic network of Dyrrn and the elder brains to steal their secrets; rather than receiving requests from your "patron," you gain flashes of insight or information about them--attacks that are going to happen, plans you might stop--that could drive your actions.

### The Ruling Clans

The Mror Holds are divided into twelve holds, each bearing the name of the ruling clan that exercises authority within that region. These twelve clans are the foundation of Mror culture, and every citizen owes allegiance to one of these clans. This section provides an overview of the twelve ruling clans, including their most remarkable mineral resources, their established feuds, and the virtues they assign to their mythic founder--and thus, the virtues they strive to embody. It's worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing. Clan Doldarun certainly values strength, but in the story, Doldarun's defining feature is his courage and integrity, while Droranath is known for his untamable strength. Likewise, while each clan includes suggestions for possible character classes, any character could come from any clan; in particular, talespinner bards and entertainers are found in every clan.

While all Mror are bound to one of the ruling clans, there are many lesser clans, and below those, tenant families. In creating a Mror character, it's up to you whether your character is tied directly to a ruling clan or if you're part of a lesser family. While many Mror take inspiration from their ruling clan, they don't all share the same virtues; in creating a Mror family of your own, you can decide what their celebrated virtues are.

Among the Mror, the dwarven subraces largely reflect their culture and personal aptitude, not bloodlines, and a Mror dwarf can take any subrace. For example, mountain dwarves have expanded martial training, likely due to militia service in Dol Udar, while dwarves with the Mark of Warding have a blood tie to House Kundarak in their family tree.

#### Clan Doldarun

- **Capital:** Silverblade Keep
- **Primary Resources:** Iron, silver
- **Enemies:** Kolkarun, Narathun, Soldorak
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Courage, honor, skill at arms. Resist Corruption.

The talespinners of Clan Doldarun say that their legendary founder was the child of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, and the dwarves of Doldarunhold take this to heart. Doldarun soldiers have always been among the best-trained and mostdisciplined warriors among the dwarves, and they're the most inclined to place their lives at risk for the good of all. There are countless tales of Doldarun facing terrifying monsters, fiends, and undead; if you need an exorcist in the Mror Holds, Doldarunhold is your best bet.

Doldarun suffered heavy losses in the War Below; in part because it was the clan most determined to win the war instead of accepting the current stalemate, many Doldarun soldiers died in bold strikes against the foul enemy. The clan maintains a garrisoned colony below Silverblade Keep, and is building strength for a new offensive. In the meantime, Doldarun draws a hard line against trafficking with the daelkyr or any form of fleshcrafting, and any outsider carrying symbionts receives a very hostile reaction in Doldarunhold. Clan Doldarun has an ancient feud with Clan Soldorak, and denounced Narathun twenty years ago over Narathun fleshcrafting.

Doldarun characters are likely to be acolytes or soldiers. This is an excellent clan for clerics, fighters, or paladins--especially War clerics and Oath of Devotion paladins. Rarely, perhaps once in a generation, the line of Doldarun produces dwarven Host aasimar. They attribute this to their mythical founder, child of the gods; chapter 3 has more information on playing aasimar of non-human descent while using human racial traits.

#### Clan Droranath

- **Capital:** Stonespire
- **Primary Resources:** Mercenaries, furs, meat
- **Enemies:** Toldorath, Tordannon, the Jhorash'tar
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Strength, confidence. Embrace the wild.

Doldarun is known for courage, while Droranath is fearless. What's the difference? A talespinner says that Doldarun is afraid, but even knowing that fear, chooses to stand their ground; in contrast, Droranath never sees any reason to be afraid to begin with. Droranath dwarves value confidence and optimism, and are certain that their strength can carry them through any challenge.

The Droranath dwarves value tradition, and their culture is the closest to the original Mror path before being conquered by Galifar. The Droranath never became miners; they are hunters, farmers, and above all, fierce warriors. Droranath youths have always trained with axe and hammer, long before Dol Udar made the practice common among the clans, and hide armor is standard fashion among the clan. Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called *tra dolhass*--the battle cry--a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The "Mror Howlers" are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors. They are one of the smallest and poorest clans, in part due to their violent lifestyle and refusal to embrace many modern advances, but they continue to hold their lands.

Droranath has fought the Jhorash'tar orcs since the first days of exile. They accuse the orcs of countless atrocities, many of which may have indeed occurred--centuries in the past. Droranath talespinners insist the Jhorash'tar were responsible for the destruction of Noldrunhold, and now claim the orcs are in league with the horrors of the Realm Below. In addition to ongoing skirmishes between Droranath dwarves and the Jhorash'tar, this has led to a bitter feud between Droranath and the clans that support the Jhorash'tar--Toldorath and Tordannon.

The Droranath dwarves aren't miners, and they haven't opened paths to the Realm Below in their territory. However, Droranath mercenaries have served other clans, and brought back trophies from their battles. It's Droranath tradition to claim the arms and armor of fallen foes, and the Droranath have no qualms about using symbiont weapons, though they don't celebrate them as Soldorak and Narathun do.

Droranath characters are often outlanders or folk heroes, as they are always willing to take risks to help friends. Rangers and barbarians are sound choices for Droranath; rangers are usually hunters, while those who practice tra dolhass might be berserkers or ancestral guardians.

#### Clan Kolkarun

- **Capital:** Lake Home
- **Primary Resources:** Copper, silver
- **Enemies:** Doldarun
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Diplomacy, flexibility, pragmatism. Never miss an opportunity.

The Kolkarun dwarves aren't the wealthiest clan, but they are skilled negotiators and are one of the more active clans in the wider world. Some Kolkarun dwarves believe that their mythic founder was Kol Korran, though they don't like to brag about it. They've established strong ties to Aundair, Karrnath, Zilargo, and the Talenta Plains, and Kolkarun diplomats played a critical role in securing Karrnathi support for recognition of the Holds. Kolkarun has had many alliances and feuds over the centuries, but always manages to trick others into fighting its battles. Rivals say "Kolkarun's mother was a gnome," and assert that Kolkarun dwarves are cowards and opportunists. The Kolkarun shrug and respond, "Only a fool passes up an opportunity." Currently, they have strong ties to Mroranon, which relies on their support in the Iron Council and makes use of Kolkarun as ambassadors and spies, and they have maintained strong ties to Soldorak since the Exile. Many of the most powerful members of the Aurum are Kolkarun dwarves.

Kolkarun dwarves are the most adept sailors of the Mror. While they don't focus their efforts on fishing, they have long been the primary sailors ferrying goods along Mirror Lake and facilitating trade and transit within the holds. However, House Lyrandar produces better ships than the Mror ever did, and today Kolkarun sailors are often licensed by Lyrandar.

Kolkarun was quick to explore the Realm Below before the threat was known, but even they proved unable to negotiate with the horrors of the deep. Kolkarun holds a few outposts in Sol Udar--often with the help of Droranath mercenaries--but hasn't made strong offensive moves in recent decades.

Kolkarun dwarves are among those most likely to travel, and Kolkarun entertainers, sailors, and merchants can be found across Khorvaire. Most of the Iron Council's spies are Kolkarun; the charlatan background works well for both clever merchant and freelance spy. Bard is a reasonable choice for a Kolkarun character, and they're among the few dwarves with a true interest in lore.

#### Clans Lanarak and Londurak

- **Capital:** Greenspire (Lanarak), Bounty (Londurak)
- **Primary Resources:** Agriculture, fish, alcohol
- **Enemies:** Each other
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Common sense, stoicism, enjoying life. Work hard and don't complain.

In the tales of the Exile, Lanarak and Londurak are siblings. Farmers and brewers, they're all but indistinguishable to outsiders, but the two are constantly striving to outdo each other. This mythic pattern remains true today. These holds lie on opposite sides of Mirror Lake, and they're both devoted to farming and fishing; many of the mountain clans rely on these valley clans for sustenance. But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense--to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there's a decent chance that if a bartender's a dwarf, they're from one of these two clans.

While Lanarak and Londurak don't mine metals, both traditionally farm mushrooms and red pudding in deep caverns, and both were drawn into the War Below. Londurak quickly pulled out of the war; they have sealed all passages and forbidden anyone from venturing into Sol Udar. Lanarak still tends its gardens on the upper levels. This has given Lanarak an edge over its rivals, especially as traditional Mror spirits are made with mushrooms. However, Lanarak has also suffered several significant supernatural attacks over the last few decades--outbreaks of the Frenzy and similar threats. It's rare for dwarves from these valley clans to take risks or to leave the holds, but a remarkable folk hero or sailor could hear the call of adventure.

#### Clan Mroranon

- **Capital:** Krona Peak
- **Primary Resources:** Iron, mithral
- **Enemies:** Soldorak
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Charisma, leadership, wisdom. Lead the way, but lead wisely.

Clan Mroranon has always been the largest and strongest of the ruling clans. The mythical Mroranon is said to have been the son of the last king of the Realm Below, and to have rallied the exiles to establish the Mror Holds. Talespinners say that it was Kol Korran's bargain with Mroranon that ensured prosperity for the dwarves, and Krona Peak is home to both the Iron Council and Kol Korran's Throne, the largest temple dedicated to the Sovereign in Khorvaire.

While Mroranonhold has a wide variety of mines, it's best known for iron and mithral. It has established strong ties with House Cannith, though all of the Five Nations import Mroranon steel. It has the strongest general industrial base of the holds, and Krona Peak is the largest single city in the region.

Mroranon dwarves are proud of their skills as warriors and negotiators, even if they acknowledge Doldarun and Kolkarun to be the best in those fields. What sets the Mroranon apart is leadership. Mroranon sees the future and inspires others to follow. Mroranon unites, and makes wise decisions for the good of all. This ties to the mythic story of Mroranon as the leader--Doldarun is a mighty champion, but Mroranon has the vision. Mroranon are strong supporters of the Sovereign Host and believe that the dwarves are blessed; many of the most devout Mror priests and powerful adepts hail from Mroranonhold.

With the largest and most industrialized territory, Mroranon has the deepest investment in the Realm Below. It has multiple colony outposts, including one tied to a demiplane mine and another holding an ancient fortress, and is holding a firm line while building power for another surge. Mroranon and its vassal clans have recovered many legendary relics and artifacts from the depths. While they don't oppose symbionts as strongly as Doldarun, they refuse to make use of dularash items and assert that any contact with the daelkyr or their creations is dangerous.

Acolyte, noble, and soldier are common backgrounds for Mroranon dwarves. While paladins are more likely to be found in Doldarun, clerics (especially Knowledge, Trickery, or Life), fighters, and bards are all sound choices for Mroranon. With its big cities, it's also a reasonable option for criminals and rogues.

#### Clan Narathun

- **Capital:** Shadowspire
- **Primary Resources:** Precious Stones, wizardry
- **Enemies:** Doldarun, Droranath, Toldorath, Tordannon
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Arcane knowledge, beauty, mystery. Solve mysteries, but remain unknown.

Narathun is a small clan, but has always had power. The mythic hero Narathun was the lone wizard of the exiles, and their people hoarded this knowledge. Narathun was renowned for its magewrights, especially its oracles; while they draw rubies and sapphires from their mines and produce beautiful jewelry, secrets have always been one of Narathunhold's primary exports. Narathun dwarves appreciate tragedy and sacrifices. The clan is known for its artists and its bards; its work is unquestionably beautiful, but certainly more morbid than that of other clans; it's no accident that its largest city is called Shadowspire.

In the modern age, the dragonmarked houses and traditions of Galifar have brought magewrights to all holds. But its oracles are still respected, and the Ebon Library of Shadowspire is the one of the finest schools of divination in Khorvaire. Narathun sages have always asserted that no knowledge should be forbidden, and Shadowspire holds temples both to the Shadow and to the Blood of Vol. Clan Narathun is fascinated by the Realm Below, though it lacks the forces to push as deeply into Sol Udar as it would like, and Narathun patrons might well employ adventurers willing to risk their lives in the depths. Narathun artificers have embraced the study of fleshcrafting; while they are no match for Mordain the Fleshweaver, they have made remarkable developments over the past few decades.

Narathun dwarves hold long grudges. They have never forgiven Tordannon and Toldorath for thefts that occurred before Bal Dulor, and despise Droranath for a murder that occurred eight centuries ago. Doldarun has long condemned Narathun for its "foul practices," and its pursuit of fleshcrafting has exacerbated this. However, the other clans value its jewels and its knowledge, and others have always stood in between Narathun and Doldarun. Soldorak and Narathun are staunch allies, reinforced by their interest in the Realm Below.

A character from Narathun lends itself more to introspection than interaction and bargaining, and Narathun dwarves are more likely to be artificers or wizards than warlocks. Narathun entertainers and bards produce haunting works; the College of Whispers is an appropriate choice. This is also an excellent clan for hermits, acolytes, or clerics tied to the Dark Six or the Blood of Vol. Despite the propaganda spread by Clan Doldarun, Narathun dwarves are no more likely to be evil than any others.

#### Clan Soldorak

- **Capital:** Solangap
- **Primary Resources:** Gold, platinum
- **Enemies:** Doldarun, Mroranon
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Independence, cunning. Question authority and find your own path.

In Dwarven, *sol dorak* means "defender of the realm." While most Mror legends present the legendary Lord Mror as a wise and powerful leader, the talespinners of Solangap say that Lord Mror was an iron-handed tyrant--that the hero Soldorak challenged Mror for the good of the common people, and it was this that led to the Exile. In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.

This principle is the cornerstone of the Soldorak character. "Power must be earned. The ends justify the means." They believe the common concept of "honor" is a trick that serves those in power; true honor lies in using your wits to defeat impossible odds. It was this principle that led clan nobles to found the Aurum, originally as a nexus for acts of rebellion against Galifar; today it continues to counterbalance the influence of foreign aristocrats and dragonmarked houses.

Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of *dolaur*--symbionts--and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarf artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That's the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe--that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them--but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.

While it's home to nobles and soldiers, Soldorakhold also has more than its fair share of charlatans and criminals. It's a haven for all manner of rogues and warlocks, especially Great Old One warlocks manipulating the powers of the daelkyr. While outsiders view the Soldorak as evil, they are primarily about challenging tradition and refusing to accept unearned authority; a Soldorak folk hero could champion underdogs anywhere in Khorvaire. Soldorak dwarves are typically skeptical of organized religion; there are relatively few temples in the region, and clerics and acolytes are uncommon.

#### Clan Soranath

- **Capital:** Blackhammer
- **Primary Resources:** Artisans, Eberron dragonshards, manufactured goods
- **Enemies:** None
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Industry, innovation. There's always a better way to do things.

When the exiles were driven from the Realm Below, it was Soranath who made them weapons. Clan Soranath is one of the smallest clans, but its influence reflects the talents of its artisans. Other clans have mines and fields--it's Soranath who takes what they produce and makes wonders.

Not all artisans are from Soranath, just as not all of the denizens of Soranathhold are artisans. Most blades in Mroranonhold are forged by Mroranon smiths. But Soranath artisans are unmatched in their techniques and their work ethic. Rather than being bound by secrets of the past, Soranath smiths are always looking for ways to improve their techniques, searching for new sources of inspiration. While this sounds impressive, Soranath is a small hold with limited resources, without the capabilities either in research or production of House Cannith or the Arcane Congress. The artisans of Clan Soranath won't change the world with their works, but they produce remarkable things for those who can afford it.

Soranathhold is small, with only three spires. Its families are tightly knit, and the divide between tenant and clan is a thin line. Industry is the prime virtue of Soranath, and its people work hard and live austere lives; for Soranath dwarves, a job done well is more satisfying than any luxury. Soranath has abundant deposits of dragonshard geodes, and thus isn't dependent on Tharashk, but doesn't seek to challenge Tharashk as an exporter of shards. Due to its otherwise limited resources, Soranath is dependent on other clans for many things, including protection. Soranath artificers are fascinated by the potential of the Realm Below and what they could learn both from the Udar artifacts and the symbionts of the daelkyr, and Grayroot Spire has been experimenting with fleshcrafting. However, they are artisans, not warriors; they must hire others to venture into Sol Udar on their behalf.

The Soranath dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, especially to Onatar; they are quick to assign credit for any great work to the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. There may also be a cult of the Traveler within Soranath, perhaps in Grayroot Spire; if so, it keeps its true devotion well hidden.

Soranath dwarves are generally guild artisans, acolytes, or sages. Artificers (primarily Battle Smiths) and clerics of the Forge are both logical classes for Soranath dwarves.

#### Clans Toldorath and Tordannon

- **Capital:** Frosthaven
- **Primary Resources:** Copper, medicinal supplies, livestock
- **Enemies:** Droranath, Narathun
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Empathy, generosity, loyalty. Always willing to help a friend in need, and always willing to make a new friend.

Like Lanarak and Londurak, the mythic founders of Clans Toldorath and Tordannon were siblings. Unlike their fellow exiles, Toldorath and Tordannon never quarreled. They followed the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their holds adjacent to one another; the city of Frosthaven lies directly between the two holds and serves as the capital for both.

Toldorath and Tordannon had many skills, though they were masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before Bal Dolur, Frosthaven healers were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.

At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They're stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans--to family, clan, and the holds themselves.

But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash'tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy--the modern Jhorash'tar aren't particularly adept healers--but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash'tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.

Toldorath and Tordannon have no specialty that calls out a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any character could come from Frosthaven. They have soldiers and fighters, hunters and rangers. What drives these clans is loyalty and kindness, their belief that it's always better to make a new friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy.

#### House Kundarak

- **Capital:** Korunda Gate
- **Primary Resources:** Gold, copper; dragonmarked services
- **Enemies:** None
- **Celebrated Virtues:** Insightful, perceptive, trustworthy. Offer sound advice and protect your friends from harm.

The mythic founder of House Kundarak was a stonemason who built the first shelter for the exiles. While House Sivis estimates that Kundarak's dragonmark appeared less than three thousand years ago, in the stories, Kundarak had always borne the mark and used its powers to protect their people. Dwarves of all clans relied on Kundarak, both for wise counsel and their expertise in building. Kundarak laid the foundations of the fortresses that stood against the armies of Galifar.

But soon after Bal Dulor, Clan Kundarak became House Kundarak, expanding its influence across Khorvaire. While they held onto their ancestral lands, the Korth Edicts required Kundarak to sever its ties to the other clans, putting the interests of its clients ahead of those of the Mror. While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world. Kundarak helped bring dragonmarked services to the Mror Holds, and also helped build connections between houses and clans--House Deneith and the Droranath, House Jorasco and the Frosthaven clans. So while there was some estrangement, the clans generally accepted Kundarak's new role--though Soldorak has long decried Kundarak as abandoning traditional values and selling out the dwarves.

House Kundarak has no seat on the Iron Council and is not considered a Mror clan. Kundarak has done its best to stay out of the War Below, though Kundarak engineers played an important part in building defenses during the War Below, and were well paid for their services. Despite the lure of treasures and the mysteries of the past, Kundarak has no interest in courting disaster beneath the very seat of its power; it has fortified all deep portals beneath its spires. Should it choose to send expeditions below, it would do so with extreme care and caution.

Ideas about building House Kundarak characters are presented in chapter 1 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*.

#### Noldrunhold: The Lost Clan

There are twelve holds in the Mror Holds, including House Kundarak--but there were thirteen exiles in the stories. Noldrun was clever and curious, an explorer who was always finding new things. Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine--Korran's Maw--was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of House Kundarak and Zilargo, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.

And then, approximately four hundred years ago, Noldrunhold fell silent. Messengers sent into the hold never returned. Noldrun had previously fought many fierce battles with the Jhorash'tar, and blame immediately fell to the orcs; but none could explain how the Jhorash'tar could have achieved such a massacre.

The fate of Noldrunhold remains a mystery to this day. Most contemporary records of what explorers found were passed down orally and are unreliable. In some accounts, corpses were skinned; in others, there were no corpses, as if the Noldrun had all simply vanished. Some suggest that the Noldrun all gathered together and descended into Korran's Maw; others say the Jhorash'tar killed them and threw the bodies into the Maw. Neighboring clans Soldorak and Droranath both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned--again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The Droranath blame the Jhorash'tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of Jhorash'tar still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran's Maw.

Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below--that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that's all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the Jhorash'tar after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal.

#### The Jhorash'tar Orcs

The Jhorash'tar are an alliance of orc tribes that have dwelt in the Ironroot Mountains since before the arrival of the dwarves. The Jhorash'tar have no written records, but their tales suggest they once held most of the Ironroots, and that many of their tribes were annihilated in the early days of the Exile. However, others suggest that the orcs might have been eradicated by the civilization that built Sol Udar. Indeed, the existence of the Face of Mror--a mountain sculpted to resemble a dwarf king, a feat of engineering far beyond the capabilities of the modern Mror--implies the dwarves of Sol Udar were active on the surface of the mountains at some point. Whatever the truth, by the time of Bal Dulor, the bulk of the Jhorash'tar had been pushed to the southwestern regions of the Ironroot Mountains, where they continued to clash with Clan Droranath and Clan Noldrun.

The Jhorash'tar orcs have a distinct culture, with nothing in common with the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes or the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches. There are at least six distinct tribes, each split into smaller bands; the DM can add details to a particular tribe to suit the story. Some dwell on the surface of the mountains--often in caves along canyon walls--while others dwell underground, in the same layer the dwarves mined for centuries before breaking through into Sol Udar. The Jhorash'tar have never formed large communities, and usually split when a band has a hundred or more adult members, or whenever a bonecaster--their spiritual leader--advises it.

The primary spiritual tradition of the Jhorash'tar is called the Path of Bones. Bonecasters are their priests and diviners. They can speak with the dead and temporarily conjure spirits to produce magical effects, but traditionally they don't create lasting undead. A player character following this path might be a cleric with the Grave domain, though the typical bonecaster doesn't have access to all the spells and features of a cleric. Bonesworn are elite champions strengthened by spirits; a player character following this path could be an Ancestral Guardian or Zealot barbarian. The Jhorash'tar believe that the ghosts of the fallen linger, and continue to guide the living through whispers and dreams. Tribes often decorate the entrances of their dwellings with the bones of their own fallen warriors, believing that the spirits of the fallen protect them.

The Jhorash'tar don't work metal, though some are willing to use metal weapons and armor acquired from the Mror. Bonecaster rituals allow them to shape and harden bone, and they often incorporate bones in weapons and armor. While they often use the bones of large creatures, it's also common for one of the bonesworn to carry a weapon or token that incorporates an ancestor's bone. The Jhorash'tar also work with other natural materials, including wood and stone. They have no equivalent to heavy armor, but can combine bone and leather to create armor that offers similar protection to a breastplate or scale mail.

Many of the Jhorash'tar tribes wish for peace with the dwarves, and are working with the Frosthaven clans to reach an understanding. For the most part, these tribes don't want to live alongside Mror in their cities, but wish for their own recognized lands, and want the right to gather the bones of other orcs from across the holds. However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn--but it's possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.

It's up to the DM whether the Jhorash'tar were involved in the destruction of Noldrunhold. Whatever the truth, Jhorash'tar tribes live safely in Noldrun territory, though they shun its cities.

## The Thunder Sea: The World Beneath The Waves

![Artist: Vincentius Matthew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/127%20vincentius%20matthew.png)

The people of the Five Nations only think of the world in terms of the things they've seen, the lands they can visit. Forests and farmland, valleys and hills. But there's another world a Brelish farmer can't even imagine, a land of wonders a league below the water's surface, lit by bioluminescence and cold fire. This is no empty wilderness. There are civilizations in the oceans, cultures older than even those of the giants of Xen'drik.

Eberron is home to ten seas, as diverse as the continents of the world above. Each of the seas is home to powerful nations, deadly creatures, and hidden secrets. This section focuses on the Thunder Sea, beginning with an overview of the region and delving into the major cultures found there.

In general, there's little traffic between the people who dwell on land and those who live in the ocean depths. Just as a common Brelish farmer cares little about the ocean's denizens, a typical merfolk kelp-tender knows nothing of Breland and has no interest in the surface dwellers. But anyone who sails the Thunder Sea needs to know what--and who--lies below. The nations of the depths maintain their borders like any other nation, and someone who blunders into the Eternal Dominion without proper authorization faces sahuagin wrath. Most major port cities--including Sharn and Stormreach--host representatives of nearby aquatic nations, and envoys on the docks can help plan and authorize travel through their domains. As a result, most sailors know at least a little about the cultures of the waters they pass through, and every Lyrandar crew includes a "sea speaker" who knows Sahuagin and Aquan.

### Open Waters

The Thunder Sea lies between Khorvaire, Xen'drik, and Aerenal. It takes its name from the unnatural storms that rage over some areas, never-ending tempests fueled by the elemental power of Lamannia. As dangerous as these waters are, this is a crucial crossroads for trade, and there's a constant stream of ships flowing between Sharn, Stormreach, and Pylas Talaer. It's here that the sahuagin first arose, the seat of their greatest civilization.

In the dawn of time, the Thunder Sea was the domain of the Lurker in Shadow. This overlord embodies the fear of the unknown, of the evil that could be lurking just beyond sight, and the fear that our friends could be secretly scheming against us. The Lurker created the aboleths, who conquered and dominated creatures of the deep--giants, dragons, and sahuagin. The struggle against the overlords played out beneath the water just as it did above. Dragons battled krakens and giants fought aboleths, while the sahuagin consumed the fallen on both sides. The wrath of the Lurker shattered the ocean floor. Dragons were impaled on spires of demonglass. But in time, the overlords were bound and the aboleths fled into the deepest abysses.

Today, the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion are spread far and wide across the floor of the Thunder Sea. Their mightiest cities are built around--and *into*--massive slumbering creatures known as *kar'lassa*, "great dreamers." The merfolk live in the upper waters above the sahuagin. Their permanent settlements are tied to manifest zones, and they perform rituals to contain the threat posed by these zones. The other major power in the Thunder Sea is the Valraean Protectorate, the domain of the sea elves. These elves laid claim to the waters around Aerenal, conquering the local sahuagin and other species, and bending them to their will. The Dominion sahuagin despise the Valraean elves, but thus far, the power of the Undying Court has repelled every assault.

What will bring your adventurers to the Thunder Sea? Will you delve into the depths to explore ruins built by long-dead giants? Will you negotiate with sahuagin and work to prevent a war between land and sea? Or will you struggle to survive after you're pulled down by the aboleths and the ancient evils that lurk in the ultimate darkness?

#### Ports and Travel

The Thunder Sea is a critical path for trade. Any traffic with Xen'drik crosses the Thunder Sea. In addition to the ships of House Lyrandar (both elemental galleons with dragonmarked captains and mundane ships licensed by the house), the Thunder Sea sees traffic from Aerenal, Zilargo, Breland, and Riedra. The most important ports include Pylas Maradal (Valenar), Pylas Talaer (Aerenal), Sharn (Breland), Stormreach (Xen'drik), Trolanport (Zilargo), Wyvernskull (Darguun), and Zarash'ak (Shadow Marches).

These major ports see both commercial, diplomatic, and military traffic. Aereni merchants carry shipments of exotic lumber, Riedran vessels are laden with crysteel and dragonshards, Lyrandar ships carry all manner of trade goods, and smugglers sneak barrels of kuryeva and tilxin blood into hidden coves. While the standard map of Khorvaire focuses on these major ports, there are also countless smaller ports and fishing villages scattered along the coastline.

The masters of the Thunder Sea--the sahuagin--don't want dryskins blundering through their territory. Traveling directly along the coastline is reasonably safe, and local fisherfolk don't need to negotiate with sahuagin every time they set sail; the sahuagin don't lay claim to the waters within 6 miles of Khorvaire's coast, and permit fishing an additional 20 miles beyond that. But crossing the Thunder Sea is an entirely different story. Setting aside the territorial claims of the sahuagin, the sea is filled with deadly hazards--endless storms, demonglass spires, and hungry monstrosities.

The Eternal Dominion has established specific routes that captains must follow, safe from hazards and monitored by the Dominion. Captains who wish to use these routes must obtain *beacons of passage*--common magic items that tell the sahuagin their travel is authorized, charged to last for a set time. Even with a *beacon*, there are places--such as Shargon's Teeth--where a wise captain pays for the services of a sahuagin or merfolk guide.

Some brave (or foolish) souls deviate from these approved routes, whether desiring speed or avoiding the cost of local customs and the price of a *beacon*. The Thunder Sea is nearly the size of Khorvaire itself, and the sahuagin aren't everywhere; however, those regions shunned by the sahuagin and merfolk are usually avoided with good reason, and smugglers may face dangerous environmental hazards or hungry monstrosities.

> ##### Fantastic Oceans
>
>Venturing underwater can be a challenge for adventurers. They'll need assistance just to be able to breathe. Chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* presents additional rules for underwater adventures; swimming is exhausting, it's hard to see underwater, and many attacks suffer disadvantage. At the same time, it can seem as though things aren't limited enough. Shouldn't something strange happen when you generate lightning damage underwater? Shouldn't spells that deal cold damage freeze the water? And even if you can breathe underwater, if you go to the depths where the sahuagin are, thousands of feet under the surface, won't the pressure crush you?
>
>It's certainly possible to come up with more complicated rules that address all scientific concerns. But ultimately, the goal is to have a fantastic pulp adventure, not to realistically model a deep-sea dive. So it's okay to follow the rules in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* and not worry too much about the science--perhaps the magic allowing you to breathe underwater also protects you from changes in pressure.
>
>*Ghosts of Saltmarsh* also presents extensive options for running ocean adventures; many of these may offer inspiration as you build your undersea world. Regardless of the rules you decide to use, remember that the Thunder Sea isn't on Earth. In addition to the environmental effects of manifest zones, you have the aftereffects of conflict between giants, dragons, and archfiends. You have flora and fauna that don't exist on Earth, which have their own effects on the environment. A story should focus on creating an interesting, exciting environment to explore, even if it isn't a realistic match for true marine ecology.

#### The Power of Lamannia

The storms of the Thunder Sea are legendary. Beyond wind and rain, tales speak of maelstroms that drag down even the largest vessels and masses of vegetation that rise from the water to entangle ships. All of these are very real threats, even more so because these dangers don't obey simple laws of wind and water. The Thunder Sea is home to a wide range of manifest zones, but the most powerful and numerous are those tied to Lamannia. The endless fury of the First Storm lashes ships with lightning and storm winds, and great maelstroms can pull a ship down into the Endless Ocean. The vast masses of vegetation are tied to the Twilight Forest, fueling unnatural growth that can latch onto a vessel and trap it in the sargassum. Though the influence of Lamannia is most strongly felt here, it's also possible to find an unexpected region of icebergs surrounding a manifest zone tied to Risia, boiling waters around a Fernian zone, or a region tied to Mabar where the shadows of sailors turn on the living.

As any skilled ocean navigator can tell you, manifest zones are stable, physical locations. While a manifest zone's influence extends beyond its focal point, the worst storms of the Thunder Sea remain confined to specific areas. However, when the plane linked to a manifest zone is coterminous, its impact is dramatically enhanced, with storms extending beyond their usual radius and becoming far more powerful. This is why knowledge of the sea is vitally important for sailors; if you venture off the approved trade routes, you need to chart a course that will avoid the storms.

Lamannian manifest zones often release elementals into Eberron. An eternal storm may contain air elementals, while water elementals can be found in the region around a maelstrom. Such elementals aren't intentionally cruel, but they're driven to express their elemental drives--which often makes them dangerous to ships, which they perceive as alien invaders. Manifest zones can also produce dire beasts--octopi, sharks, and other creatures of remarkable size.

The merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed in more detail later in this section) serve as planar shepherds, tending manifest zones and helping to contain and mitigate their effects. This isn't absolute; the merfolk can't entirely disperse the power of the First Storm, or stop the growth of the Twilight Forest. But they seek to direct it, choosing to vent its power at times when there is minimal danger to innocents. Even when a region has especially bad storms due to a manifest zone, those storms could be far, far worse if the merfolk stopped performing their rituals or were driven away entirely.

#### The Teeth

Throughout the sea, vast spires of stone and coral rise up from the bottom of the ocean--in some cases, over a mile in height. Some reach the surface, while other clusters lie hundreds of feet below it. While these spires formed naturally, they're often interspersed with a more dangerous--and unnatural--substance. *Demonglass* is similar to obsidian, but virtually indestructible. These demonglass spires--commonly called "needle teeth"--can pierce the hull of a swiftly moving ship despite being just a few inches in width. The spires in this region were created by the Lurker in Shadow during the First War (though it wasn't responsible for the demonglass found elsewhere in Eberron, such as Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes).

The region known as Shargon's Teeth--a Common adaptation of the Sahuagin name for the Devourer--lies directly between Sharn and Stormreach, and is the most infamous manifestation of these hazardous needle teeth. Stone spires and demonglass spikes of all sizes are scattered between this chain of islands. Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a course through the Teeth without the help of a sahuagin guide; as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers and pirates, preying on ships that founder on the Teeth.

Throughout the Thunder Sea, needle teeth are a dangerous hazard for those who stray from the established trade routes--but they also provide an opportunity to interact with creatures of the sea. Any number of aquatic monstrosities may make a lair in the upper reaches of a spire. The sahuagin also often colonize the larger teeth, carving tunnels throughout a spire. High teeth thus serve as outposts projecting up to the upper waters where light can reach, allowing travelers to visit a sahuagin outpost without having to descend to the absolute depths.

#### Kar'lassa: The Great Dreamers

The greatest wonders of the Thunder Sea lie deep below the surface, all but unknown to the people of Khorvaire. The kar'lassa are enormous beasts--miles in length--half-buried and sleeping in the floor of the Thunder Sea. Not even the dragons of Argonnessen know the origin of the kar'lassa. They've slept since the beginning of recorded history, and are immune to all forms of divination magic. They could be creations of Khyber trapped before they could rise to the surface, or they could've been crafted by Eberron to guard against some future threat. Perhaps they are young progenitors, and when they finally wake, they will create new worlds.

All that's known for certain is that the kar'lassa are massive, immortal monstrosities... and that each is bound to one of the planes. Each kar'lassa radiates the effects of a powerful manifest zone, extending up to 13 miles. The appearance of each kar'lassa reflects the plane they're tied to; the kar'lassa of Shavarath is a massive draconic beast with steel scales, while the kar'lassa of Fernia is a serpent of embers, water forever boiling against its skin. But the strangest aspect of the kar'lassa is their dreams. As described in chapter 5, when mortals dream, their spirits are usually drawn into Dal Quor. However, when the kar'lassa dream, *they don't dream in Dal Quor*. Instead, each kar'lassa dreams in the plane it's tied to--and more wondrous yet, each great dreamer draws in the spirits of dreaming mortals. Any creature that dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa--including unwary sailors passing above, if any are bold enough to go off the approved travel routes--is pulled into the behemoth's dream, instead of dreaming in Dal Quor. So, for example, anyone who sleeps in the Dominion city of Hal'iri dreams their dreams in Irian. While dreaming in this way, a creature is only present as a spirit, and is immune to the negative environmental effects of that plane; so a mortal dreamer isn't hurt by the extreme heat of Fernia or the cold of Risia. Even if a dreamer dies in their dream from other causes, they just wake up. This is still *dreaming*; unless the dreamer is capable of lucid dreaming, they have little control of their actions and will likely only remember fragments of the experience. But if they do have tools or training that allow lucid dreaming (as with the *uul'kur* in chapter 7), this can be an interesting way to explore the planes.

> ##### Kar'lassa, Dar, Kalashtar, and Elves
>
>When the dar dream, they are drawn to the Uul Dhakaan, the shared dream of the empire--but when anyone dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa, they're drawn into its dream. So what happens if a golin'dar dreams near a kar'lassa? These ancient primordial forces trump the work of Jhazaal Dhakaan, and the dar are pulled into the dream of the kar'lassa instead of to Dal Quor. However, all of the dream-tools crafted by the Kech Dhakaan--the *kra'uul* and *uul'kur*--function normally within the dream of a kar'lassa.
>
>What about kalashtar? Their connection to Dal Quor has been completely severed, but they do dream; when a kalashtar sleeps, they create dreams within their own mind, drawing on their memories and their quori spirit. However, if kalashtar find themselves within the range of a kar'lassa, they're pulled into its dream, as with the dar.
>
>The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are aware of how the kar'lassa influence the dreams of "lesser" races. Though the Protectorate hasn't yet captured any Dominion cities, they take great pride in their belief that because they don't sleep, they would be above the influence of the kar'lassa--but this belief is wrong! It's true that elves trance rather than sleep, entering a deep meditative state much like a lucid dream, self-directed and untouched by the influence of either Dal Quor or a kalashtar's quori spirit. However, this process is physiologically similar to a human's dreams and can likewise be hijacked by the kar'lassa--which would be a startling experience for an elf who's never dreamed before!
>

Twelve kar'lassa have been discovered; one for each plane, aside from Dal Quor. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion have built their largest cities around eight of these great dreamers, though they've shunned the kar'lassa associated with Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the kar'lassa, and these substances are the fuel that drives their industry.

The kar'lassa are a source of wonder, not monsters to be fought. To all tests, they appear to be immortal, and regenerate damage quickly. Spells such as *flesh to stone* or *disintegrate* only work on a tiny sliver of the kar'lassa, and even that's quickly restored. If one of these ancient slumbering monstrosities were to rise, it would be an almost unstoppable force of destruction, and destroy the Dominion city in the process. If one of these vast creatures emerged onto land, it could easily devastate cities without even meaning to.

Titanic, unstoppable monstrosities that could threaten entire cities? That sounds a little like the tarrasque. And indeed, a simple way to introduce the tarrasque into Eberron is to present it as a kar'lassa rising from its slumber and threatening Sharn or Stormreach; just add the effects of a manifest zone to the region around it. The tarrasque is small for a kar'lassa; most are miles long, large enough that the sahuagin build cities around them. But it's possible a small kar'lassa might be the first to wake--can the heroes who oppose it find a way to return it to its slumber before the others wake? If a DM chooses to explore this plotline, they'll have to decide the truth about the origins of the kar'lassa. If they're the children of Eberron, they might not want to destroy innocent creatures; they could have an important purpose as yet unfulfilled. On the other hand, if they're tools of the overlords or the Devourer, their rising will spell disaster.

> ##### Krakens
>
>The Thunder Sea is home to the ancient evil of the aboleths, who yearn to dominate the minds of all creatures. It holds the sleeping kar'lassa, who could devastate cities or nations if they rose from slumber. Where do the krakens fit in this hierarchy?
>
>Krakens are children of Khyber, born in the Age of Demons. Unlike the aboleths, they weren't created by a fiendish overlord and they don't serve any overlord; each kraken is a power in its own right. Krakens enjoy exercising their power and being worshipped by lesser creatures, and each one carved out a domain within the chaos of the Age of Demons. The binding of the overlords didn't adversely affect the krakens; however, many feared that the alliance that had formed to defeat the fiends might well turn its attention to them next, so they chose to go into hiding and sleep, waiting for an age when the champions of the Age of Demons were dead and the oceans were free.
>
>Krakens are spread across all of the oceans of Khorvaire. For the most part, they don't work together, in part to avoid the interest of Argonnessen. One kraken dominating an island of humanoids is of no concern to the dragons; an alliance of krakens is another story. However, multiple krakens have occasionally joined forces. Tens of thousands of years ago, five krakens devastated the previous civilization of the sahuagin of the Thunder Sea. Despite their power, they were eventually overcome; their remains are preserved in the city of Hal'shavar.
>
>There are a few krakens in the Thunder Sea, but they avoid the Eternal Dominion, dwelling either in its fringes or in dangerous places that are shunned by the sahuagin. The kraken Bastyreth has established a sanctum below the kar'lassa tied to Mabar; it's raising a legion of undead minions and preparing to take vengeance on the Dominion.
>

#### Haunted Ruins and the Deepest Darkness

The Thunder Sea is vast and ancient. The sahuagin call their civilization the Eternal Dominion, but in truth, it's risen and fallen multiple times. The Lurker, as well, has nearly risen several times, and aboleths have set the sea devils against one another in vicious civil wars. There are a handful of storm giants in the depths, but any nation they once possessed was destroyed long ago. Remnants of these conflicts are spread across the Thunder Sea. Explorers could find an ancient temple haunted by the ghosts of the storm giants that built it, an overgrown sahuagin fortress from a previous age of the Dominion, or the tomb of a dragon sealed tens of thousands of years ago.

Most dangerous of all are the deepest abysses, strongholds of the surviving servants of the Lurker in Shadow. These cracks in the ocean floor might hold mighty artifacts forged during the Age of Demons, but they're home to aboleths, fiends, and even more terrifying creatures.

#### What Roams the Sea?

When dealing with the Thunder Sea, remember that it's just as civilized as the Five Nations. It does have wilderness regions with feral beasts roaming at will, and you might find wild plesiosaurs, a scheming sea hag, or a hungry scrag. But in the areas above and around sahuagin city-states, such beasts have been tamed or destroyed. All cultures of the Thunder Sea farm fish like the people of the land farm sheep or cattle; a pod of whales may be carefully managed and cultivated, and their farmers will be quite angry with dryskins who poach their ichthyic livestock. There are sharks--and giant sharks--in the wild waters, but in the civilized zones, the sahuagin use them much as humans use hounds. Dragon turtles serve different roles depending where they're found; in the Dominion, dragon turtles are forced to serve as beasts of burden and living engines of war, while the merfolk form alliances with dragon turtles and consider them partners in a community.

Later sections explore the relationships between the major cultures of the Thunder Sea. Here's general information about other sentient aquatic creatures in the region:

- **Locathah.** are subjects of both the Valraean Protectorate and the eastern regions of the Eternal Dominion. The locathah never had a civilization as advanced as the sahuagin, and have been subjects of the Dominion for thousands of years. However, there could be bands of free locathah on the edges of the Dominion, potentially hiding in the territorial waters of Khorvaire.
- **Storm giants.** once had a presence along the coastline of Xen'drik. After devastating conflicts with several sahuagin nations, they were all but wiped out. Today, they're generally known only through the ruins and tombs they left behind, usually protected by powerful magic and left alone by the Eternal Dominion. There are still a few storm giants in hiding; most are shadows of their former glory, but there may still be a few hidden giants who have preserved their ancient powers.
- **Dragons.** have much the same relationship with the Thunder Sea that they have with Khorvaire. There are a few rogue dragons (black, bronze, green, or gold) who pursue their personal goals in isolated regions of the Thunder Sea. Elsewhere, the Chamber monitors the Dominion just as it watches humanity, intervening only if its interests are threatened.
- ![Artist: Dean Spencer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/130%20dean%20spencer.png)
- **Kuo-toa.** have no significant presence in the Thunder Sea, though they are found elsewhere in Eberron.
- **Koalinth.** were developed by the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan to defend the coastline, though the dar never sought to cross the sea. These aquatic hobgoblins were exterminated by the sahuagin following the collapse of the empire, though koalinth tribes are occasionally discovered in remote locations. It's possible a more sophisticated clan of koalinth went into deep seclusion at the same time as other Kech Dhakaan; if so, this could be an interesting ally for the Heirs of Dhakaan.

#### Random Discoveries

What might a vessel find if it leaves the sanctioned trade routes and ventures into forbidden territories? The Thunder Sea Surprises table provides a few possibilities.

### The Eternal Dominion: Sahuagin

Any sailor in Stormreach can tell you that the sahuagin worship the Devourer, who they call Shargon. But this is only part of the story. Sahuagin storm priests tell the common tale of how gods and demons fought in the first age, but their story doesn't end with the binding of the overlords. Once the fiends were defeated, the Sovereigns were determined to take their place and rule as tyrants. The sahuagin Sha'argon was a bold hunter and mighty warrior. He stalked the Sovereigns of the natural world, Arra'ai and Ba'alor. Sha'argon trapped them and consumed them, claiming their power as his own. The other Sovereigns were angry, but none could outwit Sha'argon, and he already had the power of two gods; so they fled to the world above and beyond, and to this day, they flee when the mighty hunter draws near.

Sha'argon is the greatest of the gods. He sets the laws of the world, and they are cruel. Life is an endless struggle. The weak will perish in the storm or be consumed by the mighty. Those with cunning and courage can conquer the world itself, and the victor has the right to devour their vanquished foe. The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion take these messages to heart. There is no foe they cannot conquer, no power they cannot claim. They have forged a dominion from the bones of krakens and the blood of the kar'lassa, an empire that will never end.

If the Dominion wished to conquer the surface world, it could do so easily--or so the sahuagin say. But to what end? Dryskins are pathetic barbarians, weak in both body and mind. The Eternal Dominion seeks grander prey, power worthy of Sha'argon. Some seek to consume the overlords; others plan the conquest of worlds beyond the world. Is this pure arrogance? Or can the Eternal Dominion gain mastery over reality itself?

#### Biology

The sahuagin dwell on the floor of the Thunder Sea. They possess an uncanny ability to rapidly adapt to changing pressure, and can ascend from the depths to the surface with no ill effects. Darkvision allows them to see even in the blackest depths of the ocean, though they require at least a little light to function at full efficiency. Their tough skin is as tough as leather armor, and their claws and teeth are deadly weapons.

Human scholars are aware of the existence of sahuagin "mutants," but few realize these aren't random mutations; they're the most visible products of a system that touches every sahuagin in the Dominion. From the moment they emerge from the spawning pools, young sahuagin undergo a regimen of diet, mystic rituals, and training that shapes them for their intended purpose. Sahuagin aren't clones, but a sahuagin warrior is imbued with strength and fury, and a sahuagin assassin is swift and deadly--each by design. The sahuagin *create* their sorcerers. All Dominion sahuagin go through this initial process of shaping, and those who prove themselves worthy can go farther still, undergoing the rituals that produce champions such as the four-armed barons and the malenti. But these are just two examples of what the sahuagin magebreeders can achieve. The Claws of Sha'argon--presented in chapter 8--are another example of these magebred champions.

What do sahuagin eat? Whatever they want, and often, whoever they want. Sahuagin are voracious omnivores who demonstrate their mastery over things by consuming them. Food brings great pleasure to the sahuagin, and they take pride both in the preparation of food and in the diversity of their diet; they farm both fish and flora, and hunt creatures that can't be farmed. Eating a locathah servant can either be an act of punishment or a great honor, depending on how the meal is prepared and consumed. Like the gnolls of the Znir Pact, it's common for a sahuagin to eat at least part of a fallen enemy, though this is more to seal the victory than to honor the spirit; you haven't truly defeated someone until you've consumed them. With this concept in mind, a DM may wish to give sahuagin NPCs advantage on saving throws against any sort of ingested poison and resistance to poison damage from such poisons.

#### Victory Above All

>>Life is conflict. All things must eat or be eaten. Flee if victory is impossible in the moment, but never surrender
>>

Sahuagin culture is deeply aggressive; in any situation, they look to see how they can win. This combines with a deep sense of cultural unity; what matters isn't that I defeat the foe, it's that *we* defeat it. So while sahuagin frequently compete with other sahuagin, seeking to advance in rank and earn evolution into a higher form, this is about strengthening the Dominion, not simply personal pride. Sahuagin don't seek to cheat their way into positions they believe they don't deserve. Similarly, weakness can't be tolerated, and they spare no time on sentimentality. The sahuagin are children of the Devourer: the point of storm and sickness is to cleanse weakness and strengthen those who survive. Anyone who grows too old or infirm should be challenged by those below them--but this is rare in practice, for a sahuagin who realizes they can no longer perform their role will usually abdicate before they're challenged. It's common practice for a respected retiring leader to be consumed by their subordinates, so their spirit and skills will remain part of the Dominion. The sahuagin warrior who has grown too old to serve has no regrets about being consumed; they lived well, and now they give what strength they have left to nourish those who will come after them. A single life is fleeting; the Dominion is eternal, and your spirit lives on in your comrades who consume you. On the other hand, those seen as having no value--who are best excised from the Dominion--will simply be fed to the sharks.

Stemming from this, the people of the Eternal Dominion are extremely industrious. Sahuagin never relax, and don't understand why anyone would--if you stop moving, you're dead. They're always looking for something to do, a challenge to overcome. However, this leaves them little time for abstract reflection, romance, or whimsy; life is war, and there's no time for poetry. Some would also say this limits innovation, and the Dominion is indeed slow to change its methods. Sahuagin are austere in their needs and desires, and don't seek comfort, luxury, or personal wealth. This isn't to say the sahuagin don't enjoy life or seek entertainment--but rather, what drives the sahuagin is victory. They don't care for music or theater, but they enjoy gladiatorial combat and other forms of aggressive sport, such as public debates and arcane duels. They also love to eat, as this is a symbolic victory over whatever they're eating. Symbols of all kinds are important in sahuagin culture. Their armor, weapons, and architecture are designed to intimidate enemies and show off one's rank and status.

#### Social Structure

Sahuagin have no families nor concept of personal property. Your loyalty is to your city, and then to the Dominion as a whole. You were born in the spawning pools of your city and assigned a purpose and a *shiver*--the group of sahuagin you trained with as a child, to whom you may have a personal attachment. From there, you worked your way up to prove your value and earn a higher rank. All positions are based on merit; while the title of a military leader is often translated as "baron," the position is earned, not inherited. The city gives you equipment and lodging based on your position, though you can earn trophy items through sporting victories. Sahuagin always look for ways to prove themselves and earn advancement, but never at the expense of your shiver, your city, or the Dominion. Sahuagin find criminal behavior and those who betray their people for personal gain to be repulsive, a sign of an inferior species.','The society of the Eternal Dominion is split into three primary forces:

- The **Ra'har** ("body") is the military. The sahuagin view life as conflict, and are zealous about maintaining a strong military. When there is no active conflict, they engage in war games and engage in gladiatorial combat--both locally, and in a league against the other cities--to entertain the people.
- The **Ta'har** ("mind") are the scholars, scientists, and priests--which, among the sahuagin, are all branches of a single path. Alchemy and sorcery are core sciences in the Dominion. The sahuagin recognize divine magic as a resource, and excel at the aggressive cultivation of the faith required to channel it. Ta'har scholars advise the Ra'har, using the lessons of history to drive military strategy, while Ta'har artificers work with the Su'har to maintain the infrastructure of the cities.
- The **Su'har** ("heart") maintain the civic infrastructure. They maintain and expand the cities, ensure the steady flow of supplies, and organize the spawning pools and the education and evolution of the young. The Ta'har develop new techniques, but it's the Su'har who turn the wheels of industry.

Each city is governed by a *Sha'rei*--Council of Three--with a leader from each force. Councilors add the prefix "kar" to their force, so the *Kar'ra'har* is the military leader of a sahuagin city. Cities coordinate through the *Sha'lassa*--Council of Dreams--as described in the "Harvesting the Dreamers" section. The priesthood of the Eternal Dominion follows one of two paths. The *razh'ash*--storm priests--are devoted to Sha'argon, and serve as the primary spiritual guides of the people. They teach the harsh lessons of the Devourer, while also wielding his might in battle when needed. The second path is that of the *lass'ash*, "dream priests"; their work is important and they support the Su'har, but they don't preach to the people.

#### Territory

The Eternal Dominion claims the entirety of the Thunder Sea as its territory, and maintains outposts across the sea, often carved into stone spires that rise up to the surface. However, most of their population is concentrated in the great cities of the Dominion. These lie on the seafloor, thousands of feet below the surface, far beyond the reach of sunlight--yet illuminated by sahuagin-engineered bioluminescent coral. Each city is named after the kar'lassa it's built around, and the kar'lassa in turn are in turn named for the plane they're bound to.

***Hal'daan (Daanvi).*** The city of Hal'daan is the administrative heart of the Dominion. Here, the leaders of the Su'har develop the civic models used throughout the Dominion. This city also holds the bureaucratic archives of the Dominion.

***Hal'dol (Dolurrh).*** The smallest of the great cities, Hal'dol is a center for necromantic research. The skulls of great leaders and priests from across the Dominion are preserved in the Bone Library, where sahuagin mediums can use speak with dead to consult with them.

***Hal'fer (Fernia).***  This region has an abundance of geothermal vents, and due to Fernia's influence, it's also a source of pure elemental flame that burns underwater. Hal'fer is an industrial center working with heat and steam; it's the primary source of metal goods, and mints the currency used with surface dwellers.

***Hal'iri (Irian).*** This is a stronghold of the Ta'har, driving mystical research and holding the largest temples in the Dominion--both in reality and in the kar'lassa's dream. Many priests train in Hal'iri, and its people have grand dreams of what the Dominion can become. It's a center for exploring lofty goals, such as defeating the Valraean Protectorate, consuming the overlords to gain their power, and perhaps even conquering the planes (as discussed in the "Story Hooks" section).

***Hal'kyth (Kythri).***  The influence of Kythri supports magic tied to change and transmutation, and these are vital to the society of the Dominion. Hal'kyth is the heart of the alchemical industry. While all great cities harvest the blood of the kar'lassa (as discussed in the next section), it is Hal'kyth that has the greatest capacity for refining it. Though the Dominion is slow to innovate, the artificers of Hal'kyth are an exception, and they continue to develop new techniques; the plasmids discussed in chapter 8 were first magebred in Hal'kyth.

***Hal'laman (Lamannia).*** The flora and fauna of this region are unnaturally fertile. Hal'laman is a center for all forms of animal husbandry, and also holds the largest spawning pools of the Dominion. When Lamannia is coterminous, growth rates spike dramatically; it's always a struggle to keep the city safe during these times, with aggressive beasts swept into frenzies and vegetation becoming shambling mounds.

***Hal'shavar (Shavarath).*** This is the military seat of the Dominion, where the finest barons and strategists are trained. Here, the Ra'har of Hal'shavar establish the military traditions used throughout the Dominion. Mock battles and other grand spectacles are carried out in the grand arena of Hal'shavar.

***Hal'syra (Syrania).***  This is the center for commerce and trade with other cultures. Hal'syra even has a rarely-used quadrant enchanted so surface dwellers can breathe within it. This city is the source of the ambassadors, envoys, and merchants who deal with surface dwellers and other cultures, and it's here that the scholars of the Ta'har study surface dwellers and debate the best ways to deal with them.

These major cities are each home to hundreds of thousands of sahuagin, and the total population of the Dominion is well into the millions. Farms and other small communities scattered between the great cities are often largely inhabited by locathah, with a core group of sahuagin overlords. In between, there are large stretches with no humanoid population; here, ruins of the giants and remnants of other fallen civilizations might be found.

#### Harvesting the Dreamers

The eight greatest cities of the Eternal Dominion are built around kar'lassa, each tied to a different plane. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the slumbering behemoths, and this is the driving fuel of the Eternal Dominion. Pipelines channel the blood of the beasts, and workers dig muscle and bone out of mines carved into their flesh. The eldritch energies sustaining the kar'lassa regenerate damage at a remarkable rate; the Dominion has been harvesting them for over a thousand years, and so far, they haven't come close to taxing these resources.

All biomatter from the kar'lassa is infused with arcane energy, and the sahuagin use these substances in the same way the Five Nations rely on dragonshards. In addition, the biomatter of each kar'lassa has unique properties and potential due to the plane it's tied to. The scales of Hal'shavar can be forged into powerful armor and weapons. The steam-breath of Hal'fer is an extremely powerful catalyst for evocation magic. The blood of Hal'kyth is an exceptional conduit for transmutation. These are just a few examples of the potential of the kar'lassa, and the Dominion itself is still discovering new uses for these resources. The Five Nations have never had an opportunity to work with this biomatter and know nothing of the kar'lassa. If a group of adventurers recovered a significant amount of biomatter--or secured a trade deal with the Dominion--House Cannith could produce strange new wonders.

So the kar'lassa are priceless resources and sources of power for the sahuagin; their biomatter drives Dominion industry, and cities benefit from the effects of their manifest zones. Only eight of the twelve kar'lassa have cities built around them, due to the dangers of the manifest zones extending from the kar'lassa tied to Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. But even in the cities of the "safer" kar'lassa, the sahuagin pay a price for the power they've harnessed. When the people of these cities sleep, their spirits are drawn into the dream of the local kar'lassa--a vast alien dream that takes place in its bound plane, rather than Dal Quor. Most sahuagin aren't lucid dreamers, and don't remember their dreams with any more accuracy than most humans do. But this experience has a notable impact on the personality and aptitudes of the people of each city; the people of Hal'shavar are the most aggressive of the sahuagin, while the people of Hal'syra are the most conciliatory.

The lass'ash--the "dream priests"--are an arm of the Ta'har devoted to the kar'lassa of their cities. These priests treat the kar'lassa both as divine beings and as servants; they believe that it's their rituals and devotions that keep the dreamers safely asleep, allowing the Dominion to continue to harvest their biomatter. At the heart of each temple lies the Or'lassa, the First Dreamer--a sahuagin priest sustained by direct infusions of kar'lassa blood. These infusions cause physical mutations that often reflect the shape of the kar'lassa and the plane it is tied to, as well as keep the First Dreamer in a comatose state. Their spirit permanently resides in the kar'lassa dream, where they anchor a temple formed from their pure will. Dream priests are trained in lucid dreaming, and they use these temples as a base both for planar research and to maintain communication across the Dominion. While they reside in different planes, the temples are mystically linked through the kar'lassa, and rituals allow the priests to spiritually travel between the dream-temples, carrying messages to the other cities. And it's in the dream of Hal'iri that the spirits of the Or'lassa meet to coordinate the actions of the Dominion; this is the *Sha'lassa*, the Council of Dreams.

#### Tools and Traditions

The Eternal Dominion is an advanced civilization that employs both arcane and divine magic as part of everyday life. It's generally more sophisticated than the Five Nations, but less advanced than Aerenal. Though the Dominion possesses capabilities beyond the Five Nations, its approaches can vary dramatically; for example, while the Dominion could generate *continual flame*, light is largely provided by engineered bioluminescent coral. While the sahuagin employ all schools of magic--generally influenced by the resources of that city's kar'lassa--the Dominion's greatest advances are in alchemy, transmutation, and magebreeding.

The Dominion has an exceptional talent for producing potions, allowing Dominion forces to temporarily boost their capabilities. But their technologies go far beyond temporary alterations, as the Dominion specializes in magebreeding all manner of creatures. The sahuagin themselves are carefully engineered to excel at the tasks chosen for them. In particular, the Dominion creates magewrights and sorcerers. This process isn't quick, taking place over the course of a sahuagin childhood, and including training as well as ongoing rituals and an unusual diet. The blood of the kar'lassa is used as a transformative catalyst, combined with the sahuagin principle, "If you consume a thing you gain its power." As a result, creating a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer requires a young sahuagin to consume the flesh of a dragon--so there's a concrete limit on how many of these sorcerers the sahuagin can create.

In addition to these basic techniques that guide the evolution of a young sahuagin, the Dominion can also induce dramatic secondary mutations; many sahuagin are highly motivated by this prospect of attaining a higher form. The malenti and the four-armed barons are the best known of these, but they represent just a fraction of the Dominion's magebreeding abilities, and the DM can create additional mutants to suit the story. For example, the Claw of Sha'argon (presented in chapter 8) possesses a secondary mutation that's granted to powerful priests. These forms of ascension require rare resources and a significant amount of kar'lassa blood (drawn from a particular dreamer based on the type of transformation sought), and are only granted to sahuagin who prove themselves worthy.

In addition to altering themselves, the sahuagin put many enhanced beasts to good use. Enhanced mantas are a common mount, possessing a swim speed of 90 feet. Mutated giant sharks and eels are used as larger vehicles, sometimes with seating areas formed upon their backs, other times with bony handles protruding from the beast's hide, allowing multiple riders to cling to the side. In place of warships, the Dominion fields dragon turtles with siege staffs embedded into their shells. The sahuagin have also created entirely new forms of life. The alchemists of Hal'kyth used the blood and biomatter of the kar'lassa to create plasmids: protean creatures similar to mimics, but capable of replicating the texture of inanimate objects as well as shape. Plasmids can be guards--often serving as living doors to secure chambers--but they're also a useful tool of industry, as a trained plasmid can itself become the tools a sahuagin artisan needs to perform its work.

Skilled Dominion magewrights can cast *fabricate* as a ritual, shaping raw materials into their desired form through magic. The Dominion also uses a substance called *korlass* ("dream stone"), formed from dreamer biomass, as an industrial material; it can be sculpted like clay, then fixed in its shape by a magewright ritual. *Korlass* has the strength of steel, with a texture similar to shell, though its appearance varies depending on which kar'lassa it's drawn from.

When considering the abilities of Dominion sahuagin, it's likely that storm priests are Tempest clerics or Conquest paladins, while dream priests are Knowledge clerics. Sahuagin artificers are usually Alchemists, and the most common forms of arcane spellcasters are sorcerers (either Storm Sorcery or Draconic Bloodline) and magewrights. Sahaugin warriors are typically Battle Masters or Champions, but some embrace the blood frenzy of barbarians. Bards, druids, wizards, and warlocks aren't supported by the traditions of the Dominion and are rarely encountered.

#### Subject Races

"Dominion" isn't just a title; the sahuagin dominate other creatures, from other aquatic humanoids to mighty dragon turtles. Before the rise of the Eternal Dominion, there were six locathah nations spread across the Thunder Sea; in the last thousand years, these have all been conquered and assimilated by the Dominion. Locathah laborers are now found in all of the great cities, and there are farming communities across the seafloor where locathah are ruled by sahuagin overseers.

The locathah are the most widespread subjects of the Dominion, but other creatures have been forced into servitude as well. The sahuagin of Hal'laman may have merfolk subjects. There could be a small population of subjugated koalinth near the coast of Darguun, or a city where there are still a few storm giants compelled into service. Typically, creatures that are Dominion subjects know the Sahuagin language, either instead of Common, or in addition to it (if they have regular contact with dryskins).

The Kalamer merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed later in this section) have largely been allowed to remain independent, as long as they continue to serve the needs of the Dominion. The Kalamer provide a valuable service, containing the impact of dangerous manifest zones and serving as intermediaries between the Dominion and the Valraean Protectorate.

#### Foreign Relations

The people of the Five Nations know little about the Eternal Dominion. Ambassadors and envoys have visited Hal'syra, so there are stories drifting around that the sahuagin city is built around a massive, mysterious creature. This experience and the occasional clashes when people have challenged the territorial demands of the Dominion have taught the Five Nations and the houses to respect the Dominion, but they still know almost nothing about it, aside from the fact that they worship the Devourer. The Aereni have greater knowledge of the Dominion, and have seen its power in the long conflict with the Valraean Protectorate. They know about the kar'lassa, but because of the ongoing conflict, haven't actually explored its lands or visited its cities. So any adventurers who venture into the Dominion are pioneers, exploring unknown realms; academic institutions and dragonmarked houses alike will surely want to hear about their exploits.

For their part, the sahuagin have little interest in the affairs of the dryskins. At this time, the Dominion has no interest in conquering the surface world, and they don't believe the dryskins pose any threat to their rule of the sea. However, the proud sahuagin don't want surface-dwellers bumbling through their territory or polluting their waters. They enforce their territorial waters as a show of strength, demanding that travelers pay tolls and follow the established trade routes.

The Dominion remained neutral in the Last War. Trade between the sea and the surface has been limited, but has expanded in recent years. In particular, Merrix d'Cannith has discovered that the sahuagin have a surplus of Siberys shards; the shards fall into the ocean, but the Dominion economy is based on the blood of the kar'lassa as opposed to dragonshards, and they have little use for them. As such, the Dominion has much to offer Cannith, and securing a steady supply of Siberys shards would strengthen Merrix's position within his house. The trick is finding something the Dominion wants in return, and he's currently pursuing this. Merrix (and other dryskins) are as yet unaware of the vast resources of the kar'lassa; if they were discovered, and Cannith found a way to harness them, it could change the face of industry in Khorvaire.

The Dominion despises the sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate, and in the past, they've launched full-scale campaigns against them, but the power of the Undying Court has thus far repelled all assaults. Currently, it's a stalemate; the Protectorate can't expand beyond the Undying Court's sphere of influence (as discussed later in this section), and the Dominion can't drive them back.

#### Sahuagin and Malenti Adventurers

The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion aren't driven by the desire for gold that draws many humans to the path of adventure. Most are fiercely devoted to the Dominion--but what if your duty to the Dominion requires you to venture onto dry land? Perhaps you need to negotiate with the dryskins. Maybe you're seeking information on a force that's meddling with the Dominion--is it House Cannith or the Lords of Dust? Perhaps you're pursuing your peoples' goal of consuming an overlord or conquering the planes. Maybe you've been sent to study the dryskins themselves, to decide whether they're worth conquering. Or you might just be an exile or a rebel, a rare outlier who opposes the ambitions and actions of your people.

While this book doesn't include racial traits for sahuagin, you can use the locathah traits from *Locathah Rising* (available on the Dungeon Masters Guild), and simply describe the character as a sahuagin. The Blood Frenzy trait of sahuagin NPCs is a special feature magebred into sahuagin soldiers, and not possessed by the general population (though you could represent this trait by playing a sahuagin barbarian).

However, there are two significant challenges to adventuring as a sahuagin. The first is that you're an alien, a creature with a face few recognize, and that those who do typically view with fear. The second is the Limited Amphibiousness trait possessed by both sahuagin and locathah--a need for regular immersion in water can be a crippling requirement when an adventure leads to the Blade Desert. However, the sahuagin have developed a solution that solves both of these problems. While most people of the Five Nations have never *seen* a sahuagin, that doesn't mean they've never *met* one. Scholars who study the sahuagin know of malenti, sahuagin that are born indistinguishable from sea elves; the common belief is that this is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren't born, they're *made*. One of the sacred rituals of Sha'argon allows a sahuagin priest to guide a subject through ritually consuming a humanoid--and in consuming the creature, the sahuagin *becomes* that creature, taking both their form and their powers. People know about sea elf malenti, as they've been caught and exposed in the Dominion's long war with the Protectorate. But unbeknownst to the Five Nations, there are human malenti in Sharn, dwarf malenti in Stormreach, malenti passing as many races and traveling the surface wherever the Dominion needs eyes and hands.

Chapter 6 provides a malenti background that could be coupled with any race, along with additional story hooks for malenti adventurers. Using this background, you can secretly play a sahuagin who's assumed the identity of the person they appear to be. While the Dominion has carried out a few targeted replacements to get malenti into influential positions, often malenti are just replacing people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: smugglers, fisherfolk, or pirates who strayed into Dominion territory. The purpose of this replacement isn't to take advantage of the character's previous life, but rather to place agents who can breathe on land and move freely without drawing attention. So as a malenti you might have been a sailor or a pirate--but now you're an adventurer traveling the world!

> ##### Other Sahuagin
>
>The sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion are an advanced and ancient culture that has little interest in the surface world. Its people generally wouldn't randomly attack a fishing village. But what if you want an adventure where the sahuagin attack?
>
>The Eternal Dominion is a culture, but the sahuagin species extends beyond it. In Khorvaire, you have humans of the Five Nations, but you also have humans of the Shadow Marches and humans of the Demon Wastes. Similarly, the Eternal Dominion hasn't extended beyond the Thunder Sea, and sahuagin in other waters may be very different; perhaps the sahuagin off the shores of the Demon Wastes have been twisted by their devotion to fiends. Even in the Thunder Sea, the border sahuagin are wilder than those of the inner Dominion, and you could find sahuagin in the fringes that have never accepted the traditions of the Dominion. The Eternal Dominion is a sahuagin culture, but it's not the only option. With that said, the secondary mutations--the barons, the malenti, the Claws of Sha'argon--are created using Dominion rituals and the blood of the kar'lassa, and these should be tied to the Eternal Dominion.

#### Story Hooks

The Eternal Dominion has no interest in conquering Khorvaire--at least for now. But the sahuagin believe life is conflict, and if you aren't moving forward, you'll wither away. This section contains story hooks and major aspirations of the sahuagin that might drive an encounter--or an entire campaign.

***The Valraean Cold War.*** The sahuagin hate the sea elves and yearn to hold dominion over the entirety of the Thunder Sea. The power of the Undying Court protects the elves from any direct assault, so the sahuagin must find another answer. They've been embedding malenti agents into the Valraean Protectorate for years. What's the next step? Will they launch a decisive first strike from within the Protectorate? Will they target Shae Mordai itself? Might they be willing to forge an alliance with a dragonmarked house or a dryskin nation to bring down the Protectorate?

***Consume the Overlords.*** The sahuagin don't need more land, but they're always hungry for more power. The most powerful beings in Eberron are the overlords of the First Age. These archfiends have lingered in their prisons since the dawn of time--while they can't be destroyed, could they be *consumed?* Could a sahuagin champion follow Sha'argon's path to divinity by somehow devouring the essence of an overlord, thus taking its spirit and strength? This goal could bring sahuagin agents to the surface if they determine the most vulnerable overlords are imprisoned on land. This is no simple task; it could require eldritch machines, planar alignments, and a particular unfolding of the Prophecy. Rak Tulkhesh is bound to multiple shards; perhaps the sahuagin have found a way to consume these one at a time, and now seek each shard. What will happen if a sahuagin champion completes this ascension?

***The Conquest of the Planes.*** The kar'lassa give the Eternal Dominion a foothold in eight planes, and they've been learning new ways to exploit this over the last century. Now, some among the Ta'har wonder if they could expand their influence, using the kar'lassa as an anchor from which to conquer a layer of a plane. This idea is unprecedented--is it even possible? Success could depend on recovering artifacts created by the Cul'sir giants during their war against the quori, and the sahuagin would need a way to bind the immortal spirits of that plane. Which plane will they try to conquer? What would happen to Eberron if they succeeded?

***Strange Trade.*** A group of adventurers could accompany a Cannith delegation sent to Hal'syri to negotiate for Siberys shards. Or they could be sent to the ocean floor in search of kar'lassa blood or forgotten relics from ancient ruins.

***Deadly Shortcuts.*** A vessel could run afoul of Dominion forces when it strays into forbidden territory, adventurers finding themselves bound for Hal'shavar, compelled to battle in the great arena. Or perhaps a dragonmarked heir could change their fate, bargaining with the sea devils and initiating an alliance with their house.

***The Lurker in Shadow.*** The schemes of the Lords of Dust threaten all people. When aboleths serving the Lurker in Shadow threaten a coastal community, the adventurers could end up working alongside Dominion champions to fight the archfiend. Perhaps an aboleth uses sahuagin thralls to try to start war between the surface and the sea; can the adventurers expose the plot?

***Locathah Rising.*** The locathah were conquered long ago, and toil as subjects of the Eternal Dominion. But a resistance could be forming within the locathah, drawing adventurers into the conflict. Some locathah may possess the gift of lucid dreaming, allowing them to meet secretly within the dreams of the kar'lassa; they have no weapons in the waking world, but they could be building schemes and supplies in their dreams.

### Karakala: Merfolk

Children of the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, the merfolk have been drawn into Eberron time and again during grand convergences between the planes. Merfolk can be found across the seas of Eberron, and every kara--tribe--has its own traditions and customs. The primary merfolk culture in the Thunder Sea is Karakala, whose members call themselves the Kalamer.

The Thunder Sea has many strong manifest zones to Lamannia, the source of the endless storms that give the region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion were lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged. At the height of this disaster, Kalamer merfolk were pulled through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the sahuagin and sea elves agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper waters, so long as they managed the manifest zones. Today, many Kalamer consider the Thunder Sea their new home, and travel from zone to zone, practicing their primal traditions. In a sense, they're nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As they're recognized as neutral by both the Dominion and the Protectorate, they often serve as messengers, couriers, and mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these powers--an important role, as the sahuagin refuse to speak directly to the sea elves. The reach of Karakala extends along the southern coast of Khorvaire, and the arrival of a Kalamer bard is often a celebrated event in small Brelish or Zil fishing villages; more than once, they've managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.

Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all with traveling between the manifest zones--which they call the roots--and performing the rituals that keep them stable. However, there are Kalamer pods who quietly despise those who bend nature for their own benefit--dryskin, sahuagin, and sea elf alike--and especially oppose the use of elemental binding; these have come to see House Lyrandar as their foes. There are Kalamer who dream of someday cleansing the oceans of all traces of industry, of unleashing the full power of the manifest zones instead of keeping them contained. To date, Karakala has maintained its peaceful course, but it's always possible that their darker impulses will rise to the fore--that they'll show House Lyrandar and the nations of the world the true power of the storm.

#### Culture

The Kalamer are a primal people, feeling the currents, tides, and winds in a profound way; some say that the ocean sings a song. Consider these philosophies when dealing with merfolk of Karakala:

- *"The water is always moving; follow it, let the currents guide you."* Kalamer prefer to remain in motion, and deeply rely on instinct and intuition.
- *"Flow around a problem or away from it."* Kalamer value flexibility over pride and aggression.
- *"Keep only that which lifts you up, not what drags you down."* Kalamer avoid anything that anchors them too strongly to one place or mood, including property and vendettas.
- *"Make no judgment until you know the story."* Kalamer are naturally curious and seek to understand the people and things they encounter.

Karakala is a culture rather than a nation. There are approximately ten thousand Kalamer spread across the Thunder Sea, but they claim no territory and have no single leader. Most live in small pods, following a pattern of migration between the manifest zones of the upper water. When they reach a manifest zone, they remain there for a week or so, performing primal rituals that stabilize the zone. They prize manifest zones to Lamannia, and time spent at a Lamannian zone is a time of celebration. However, they travel to all manifest zones, and their rituals can contain the harmful effects of any manifest zone.

The Kalamer don't worship deities, but revere the forces of nature and believe the world speaks to those who listen. While outsiders might view this as worshiping Eberron, the Kalamer don't need to anthropomorphize nature for it to be worthy of reverence. The Kalamer value wisdom over strength, and the leader of the pod holds that position because the others trust their instincts; often they're an elder, but age isn't a requirement.

In general, Karakala is peaceful; this is one reason both the Dominion and Protectorate allow the Kalamer to move freely. Most merfolk seek to understand any threats they encounter, to see if they can find a way to coexist--or failing that, to simply move past the danger. However, they can be dangerous foes when they're forced to act or encounter a true threat to the balance of nature.

Kalamer fashion is simple and functional. It's rare for Kalamer to wear anything heavier than leather armor, and most just wear leather straps to hold their tools and personal possessions. Many carry small tokens--shells, stones, bones--that remind them of a place or moment. Sometimes humans describe hearing the sound of the ocean in a shell; however, many Kalamer truly receive primal impressions from natural objects.

Kalamer speak Aquan, their native tongue from Lamannia. Most of them also speak either Elvish, Common, or Sahuagin, depending on where their route takes them, and merfolk bards may speak all of these. Any Kalamer capable of casting at least one Druidic spell can speak Druidic, which they consider to be the language of the wind and water.

#### Territory

The merfolk of Karakala can be found across the Thunder Sea; Kalamer pods follow migratory patterns, while wandering sirens let intuition guide them. The Kalamer remain in the upper waters where sunlight allows photosynthesis. There are no Kalamer cities, but they establish simple outposts along their migratory paths, often in masses of floating vegetation (which are especially common in Lamannian manifest zones).

Many pods bond with a dragon turtle, which serves as the locus of the pod; the merfolk strap themselves to the turtle when they sleep. Unlike the dragon turtles of the Eternal Dominion, this is a symbiotic relationship; the merfolk help their companion find food and keep the dragon turtle entertained. Other pods bond with gargantuan beasts that have passed into Eberron from Lamannia.

#### Tools and Traditions

Karakala has no tradition of wizardry or artifice. However, most Kalamer possess at least a touch of primal magic, and can shape water or strike a foe with a thunderclap; this can be reflected by giving Kalamer merfolk a cantrip or single-use spell from the druid or ranger spell list. Kalamer with greater gifts are called stormcallers, and can summon lightning and wind; these are discussed in more depth in chapter 8. Kalamer champions could possess the abilities of rangers or druids, and might be able to assume the forms of deadly sea creatures.

Other Kalamer hear music in the motion of wind and water and become bards. Kalamer sirens can weave illusions with their words, or cloud the minds of enemies. These sirens often travel alone, sharing news and songs both with Kalamer pods and with all other ships and communities they come across. While most Kalamer bards seek to bring joy to everyone they encounter, there are stories of sirens turned bitter after the destruction of a pod or witnessing great cruelty; these merfolk may turn their powers to punishing those they see as evil. Kalamer bards generally rely on their voices as opposed to using instruments, and can sing while submerged.

The people of Karakala create their tools from natural materials--stone, shell, leather, bone. Their magic items--mostly potions, amulets, and charms--produce primal effects.

#### Foreign Relations

Karakala is politically neutral, holding no nation or people above any other. A siren or pod may have a strong bond to a particular fishing village, but that affection doesn't extend to the dryskin nation that claims it. Generally, Karakala tries to ignore the actions of nations, focusing on its never-ending pilgrimage, though individual Kalamer--sirens, triton champions--may become more actively involved with a single nation.

While they maintain their neutrality and serve as messengers and couriers between all the people of the sea, Karakala doesn't *like* the Eternal Dominion or the Valraean Protectorate. The Kalamer dislike seeing any creature held in bondage, and they may help renegade locathah or smugglers sailing beyond approved Dominion routes. However, while they may help peaceful smugglers, they dislike cruelty and greed; violent pirates can find that the merfolk are just as dangerous as House Lyrandar or a Dominion patrol.

To date, Karakala has been a passive, mediating force, trusted by all. But the fact remains that Kalamer dislike all forms of industry in the sea. If it were an option, many Kalamer would destroy all dryskin shipping and shatter the cities of the Dominion and Protectorate alike. Currently, they work to contain the manifest zones of the Thunder Sea and to keep peace; but if they chose, they could instead release the power of these zones to terrible effect. Hostile Kalamer could begin by calling elemental tempests and megafauna beasts from Lamannia and unleashing them into shipping lanes, increasing the dangers of the sea--with plausible deniability as to their source. By coordinating rituals with coterminous periods, the Kalamer could dramatically enhance the effects of manifest zones. Using the Lamannia zones in this way, they could create devastating hurricanes and tsunamis. Could tidal waves devastate Stormreach, or elemental hurricanes topple one of the towers of Sharn? Karakala has no interest in conquest; if the merfolk pursued this course of action, it would purely be to drive commerce and civilization from the sea.

#### Merfolk Adventures

Kalamer are at home in the water, and rarely have any interest in walking on dry land. However, a few do hear the wind calling them to emerge from the water. A Kalamer who embraces this path can gain the ability to transform into a fully humanoid form--that of a triton--able to operate freely in dry land.

Most Kalamer tritons have a strong sense of purpose--a call that's drawn them to leave their pod and the sea behind. In general, the Kalamer work to protect the balance of nature; a triton might be drawn to investigate the Mourning, to help the Gatekeepers battle aberrations, or even to oppose the dragonmarked houses. Such a champion of nature might be a coastal druid of the Circle of Land, a ranger (likely a Hunter, Monster Slayer, or Horizon Walker), or even a paladin with the Oath of the Ancients.

The Kalamer triton could also be a bard; sometimes it's easier to investigate the Mourning or fight dragonmarked houses with words instead of primal magic. Triton bards are likely to follow their people's drive to help bring people together and settle disputes. The College of Glamour could reflect the enthralling song of the siren, but the College of Lore is also an option for a bard.

As a Kalamer triton, you've left your entire world behind you. Do you miss your pod and the songs of the ocean? Or are you following the basic drives of Karakala--to always move forward, and not to let the anchors of the past pull you down? As someone born in a wild, primal world, how do you deal with the intense civilization of a city such as Sharn?

> ##### Variant Rule: Kalamer Triton
>
>Kalamer tritons use the triton racial traits provided in *Volo's Guide to Monsters*, with two changes. These replace the Languages trait of the standard triton:
>
>***Kalamer Transformation.*** When you finish a short rest, you can change your form. You can either take on the two-legged form of a triton, or the form of a merfolk with a tail. While in merfolk form, your base walking speed is reduced to 10 feet, and your swimming speed is increased to 40 feet. When you assume merfolk form, you can choose whether equipment and clothing worn on your legs falls to the ground, or whether it's merged into your body until you resume your triton form. The transformation has no other effects.

>***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aquan.

#### Story Hooks

The Kalamer aren't conquerors. What could draw them into a story? Consider the following ideas.

***The Traveling Siren.*** As adventurers visit a coastal town, they hear a beautiful, clear song rising from the harbor and see people running towards the pier. The arrival of a Kalamer siren is a celebrated event along the southern coast; even the Ghaal'dar welcome friendly sirens. These bards bring news and stories of the sea--of ships in the area, storms, or even just gossip from the next village down the coast--combined with enthralling song. Aside from being an interesting scene, the siren could bring news that's directly relevant to the adventurers--perhaps news of a ship they were waiting for that was sunk offshore, or perhaps they'll share a story of a ruin hidden off the coast. As sirens act as intermediaries, a bard could also come carrying a message for the adventurers from a powerful figure in the Dominion or Protectorate.

***Salvation at Sea.*** Perhaps the characters' ship leaves the safe trade routes and runs afoul of an endless storm. Or maybe they're simply crippled by pirates, or by a forgotten weapon of the Last War. A pod of Kalamer can save the characters, using primal magic to allow the dryskins to breathe underwater, helping them to safety. But do the Kalamer need something in return? A powerful monstrosity could be lurking around a manifest zone, preventing the pod from performing their rituals. Or an aboleth serving the Lurker in Shadow may have captured members of their pod; they need help to defeat the beast.

***The Vengeful Storm.*** Though Kalamer are peaceful, the stormcaller Llaratala can no longer share the water with House Lyrandar and its oppression of elementals. She and her pod are targeting elemental galleons, shattering Lyrandar ships and freeing the bound spirits. The house hires the adventurers to find out who's responsible for the destruction of their vessels. How will the characters track the merfolk mastermind, and what will they choose to do?

***Druidic Allies.*** A Kalamer hails the druid of the party while the adventurers are on the coast or on a ship. The stormspeaker addresses them in Druidic, as a fellow defender of the natural world, asking them to help deal with an unnatural threat. This could be an aboleth or aberration, or a danger posed by a manifest zone--such as Mabar or Fernia--that's experiencing a wild surge and steadily growing worse. Can the druid and their companions help contain the threat?

***Intermediaries.*** The Kalamer act as couriers and envoys between the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion. While sailing, the adventurers come upon a dead Kalamer. The message it was carrying could be the key to stopping a new outbreak of war between these two nations. Can the characters find a way to deliver it?

### The Valrean Protectorate: Sea Elves

Long ago, the waters along the western coast of Aerenal were inhabited by peaceful locathah. The sahuagin of Sha'argon's Kingdom--a predecessor to the Eternal Dominion--steadily advanced toward Aerenal, conquering and assimilating the locathah. Concerned by the obvious aggression of the sahuagin, the Sibling Kings acted to secure the waters around Aerenal, establishing a buffer zone that would ensure that Sha'argon's Kingdom posed no direct threat. The line of Valraea was chosen, and through the power of the Undying Court, its nobles were physically transformed into sea elves, gaining iridescent skin and the ability to breathe beneath the water.

Initially, the line of Valraea served as protectors and advisors, organizing the locathah and helping them construct superior defenses. Then the attacks began. The conflict slowly escalated; the harder the locathah fought, the more it drove sahuagin determination to claim the region. Valraean priests brought the full power of the Undying Court to bear against the attackers, and Sha'argon's Kingdom couldn't match their transcendent might. A generation later the sahuagin returned, and the elves retaliated, using the divine power of the Undying Court to seize the Sha'argon border fortresses. It was at this time--when the region claimed included both sahuagin and locathah lands--that the elves officially declared it the Valraean Protectorate. According to the proclamation, the Undying Court would protect all peoples of the Protectorate and the line of Valraea would provide them with guidance and security... all of which was a gentle way of saying that the people were now under Aereni rule and would be forced to embrace Aereni customs. While this decision was driven in part by a desire to ensure the island's security, it may have also been tied to the discovery of dragonshard deposits along the seabed--both fallen Siberys shards and indications of deep Khyber shards.

The next thousand years brought chaos, as the sahuagin--first Sha'argon's Kingdom, then the Eternal Dominion--continued to attack and the Valraean elves continued to retaliate by conquering additional sahuagin territories. But the power of the Undying Court is geographically limited. While clerics can draw on the power of the Court to cast spells anywhere in the world, the transcendent might that can repel dragons or defeat sahuagin armies has a limited range. When the elves pressed beyond that, they suffered terrible losses; and yet, the Dominion couldn't challenge the elves within the Court's sphere of influence. This began a long stalemate that continues to this day. The Eternal Dominion has launched numerous attacks over the last few centuries, testing the power of the Undying Court, but thus far, the might of the deathless has been sufficient to repel every sahuagin assault.

#### Culture

Most subjects of the Valraean Protectorate are locathah and sahuagin; despite this, the Protectorate is modeled after Aereni society in many ways. In Aerenal, any elf can prove themselves worthy of joining the noble line. In the Protectorate, subjects likewise strive to prove their worth--but in this case, they seek to be worthy of *serving* the elves of the noble line. Valraean subjects are raised to believe that all elves are semidivine beings. They're ancient and wise, masters of powerful magic and remarkable skills... and most importantly, only elves can ascend to join the Undying Court.

The sea elves of the line of Valraea live in the midst of this enforced adulation. They're idolized and adored from birth, and have been playing the role of divine guardians and guides for so long that many have come to believe it: they *were* shaped by the Undying Court to be the guardians of the sea, and they do stand above their adoring subjects. But while the Valraean sea elves are often arrogant and overconfident, they generally strive to live up to that vision, to protect anyone in their charge, to be the noble and gracious rulers that (most of) their subjects imagine them to be. They aren't petty tyrants; they believe in ensuring the safety and security of their people--but they also feel no qualms about the fact that their subjects are ultimately trapped in their lives, with all positions of power held by sea elves. They consider their privilege logical and natural; and so do the overwhelming majority of Valraean subjects, who believe the elves, with their long lives and deathless ancestors, are more capable than other mortals could ever be with their fleeting lifespans.

Meanwhile, Valraean subjects believe they too are elevated above all outsiders, lower than the elves, but still blessed to receive the guidance of the elves and the living (or rather, deathless) gods of the Undying Court. And most subjects strive to prove themselves worthy of this blessing. All subjects of the Protectorate receive an education and learn trades. Its people engage in simple industry that no Aereni elf wants to dirty their hands with, as well as laboring to provide an important source of dragonshards for the mainland. In all of this, Valraeans are generally honest and industrious, trying to emulate the Aereni and perfect their skills; but they're taught that they'll never be as gifted as elves, since an Aereni elf spends an entire locathah lifetime in just their initial studies. This reflects the cornerstone of Valraean culture, which is, boiled down, that *elves are glorious and better at everything than you*. As a Valraean you're just lucky to be near elves, to have their guidance and protection. It's your duty to honor the Undying Court, because without it, you would be torn apart by the vicious sahuagin in the cruel world outside the Protectorate. And while no non-elf has ever proven worthy to join the Undying Court--how could they, with a paltry century to perfect their skills--maybe, just *maybe*, if you keep working hard enough and become the best person you can be, you might be the first.

While many members of the line of Valraea believe their own propaganda, the simple truth is that the benevolent Protectorate is an oppressive regime, sometimes brutally so. The line of Valraea has long worked to stamp out all traces of the native cultures, replacing the local languages with Elvish and eliminating the locathah religion. Few subjects publicly challenge elven rule, but those who do are quickly silenced. But despite these efforts, there are those among the masses who resist the Valraean propaganda and seek to reclaim and preserve their ancient traditions. Rebel sahuagin may work with malenti and support Dominion espionage. The locathah have a more difficult path, as for their kind, life in the Dominion would be even worse than in the Protectorate. But the locathah resistance still clings to hope, believing that as long as they are free in their hearts, they may yet find a way to overthrow all of the tyrants.

Valraean subjects are split into houses, each of which includes members of multiple species; this, in part, serves to deemphasize the importance of direct family. Each house has a patron in the Undying Court. They are taught to idolize this patron and believe that it personally protects them; in some cases this may actually be true, though many deathless councilors pay no attention to their Valraean devotees. Regardless, the Valraeans' ongoing adoration of the Undying Court provides a valuable source of positive energy for the Court itself.

Valraean fashion largely mirrors that of Aerenal, though using different materials. Fine leather takes the place of cloth, and Valraeans generally wear less clothing than their counterparts on the surface. Coral, ivory, and bloodvines (described in Tools and Traditions) are often used as ornaments. As in Aerenal, masks are important accessories; elves wear full face masks, while accomplished non-elves generally wear masks that cover their lower faces.

All subjects of the Protectorate speak Elvish. This replaces Aquan among locathah and Sahuagin among sahuagin. Those who dream of resistance work to preserve their ancestral languages, but they're not spoken where elves can overhear them.

> ##### Valraea and the Undying Court
>
>The sea elves of the Valraean Protectorate are Aereni elves, though they use a different subrace. They still have cousins on the surface, take vacations on Aerenal, and travel to Shae Mordai to consult with the Deathless Councilors. So while there's some cultural divergence, they're still loyal to the fundamental principles of Aerenal and think of themselves as Aereni. And most of all, it is possible for sea elves of the line of Valraea to become deathless. There are deathless sea elves in the Valrean Protectorate--soldiers and councilors who protect and guide the people--and a few ancient sea elves sit on the councils of Shae Mordai.
>
>Some remarkable locathah and even sahuagin have been preserved as spirit idols, and these are held up as paragons to the common people; this is immortality you can attain! While the hope that a non-elf could become deathless has long been dangled in front of the people, it's never been done, and isn't something any elf believes is possible. However, the possibility is explored in Story Hooks later in this section.
>

#### Territory

The Valrean Protectorate extends approximately 150 miles from the coast of Aerenal. Within this radius, the Undying Court wields great power; it can control the weather and produce other dramatic environmental effects. As a result, the Protectorate truly seems a blessed land; the waters are peaceful and the weather is beautiful. The Protectorate includes settlements along the shelf in the upper water and on the ocean floor.

The Protectorate has fought many wars with the Eternal Dominion and its predecessors. Ultimately, the transcendental power of the Undying Court holds enemies at bay, but over thousands of years, the Protectorate has developed and fortified defenses on the border of their territory. A series of bone-coral towers stand along the front, connected by rune-lines--glowing patterns engraved in the sea-bed that help focus and channel the power of the Court when it is needed. The region contains *spirit mines*--floating ivory spheres that conjure angry ghosts into any ship that comes too close--and other defenses. All shipping is wise to follow the sanctioned routes for entry.

The manifest zones in this region are mostly tied to Irian and Mabar. However, there are a few manifest zones tied to Lamannia, and those in the upper waters are prone to the violent surges seen in zones across the sea. While the Undying Court can contain these surges, this is an expenditure of energy on their part; as a result, the Valraeans welcome the merfolk of Karakala, whose rituals stabilize the zones.

#### Tools and Traditions

Valraeans of all species practice the same traditions as the elves of Aerenal. Though magic is widespread in the Protectorate, Valraean subjects aren't taught the higher arts, so the overall level of common magic is more on par with the Five Nations, with greater wonders seen in the coral palaces of the line of Valraea. The common populace of the Protectorate includes magewrights and adepts, with a handful of gifted wizards. While all subjects are taught to worship the Undying Court, the actual priests are sea elves.

Sea elves of the line of Valraea typically focus on divine or arcane magic. The sea elves are encouraged to think of themselves as divine champions, and many do become clerics or paladins. Arcane spellcasters are typically wizards, and the strengths of the Protectorate are divination, abjuration, and necromancy. There are also a handful of artificers among the line. While the power of the Undying Court defends the region, the line of Valraea maintains the many wards and monitors the seas for sahuagin activity, or any other threat that might arise.

The artisans of the Protectorate work with the exotic woods of Aerenal, but they use other exotic materials as well. Leather is the primary material used in clothing, both fine, thin leather for simple fashions, and tougher hides for armor. Bone-coral is a form of coral that is artificially grown and hardened using arcane techniques, used for everything from buildings to ornaments. Bloodvines are an aquatic form of Aereni livewood; they draw sustenance from any creature in contact with them (though not so much as to be noticeable in any way) and thus remain alive, even when shaped into ornaments or armor.

The artificers of the line of Valraea are curious about the arcane potential of kar'lassa biomatter--the foundation of Dominion arcane magic--and are always eager to acquire it. Valraean sahuagin don't have access to the magebreeding and alchemical techniques of the Eternal Dominion; as a result, they develop as any other creatures would, instead of being guided down a particular path. This also means the Protectorate doesn't have any of the secondary mutants--such as barons, malenti, and Claws of Sha'argon--found in the Dominion.

#### Foreign Relations

The Valraean Protectorate is an extension of Aerenal, and diplomacy with surface nations is conducted by the elves of the islands. Generally, the only time surface-dwellers encounter sea elves or Valraean subjects is at customs checkpoints when approaching Aerenal; thus, sailors may be familiar with them, but most people of the Five Nations have never seen a sea elf or a locathah. Aerenal takes the security of its coastal waters seriously, and ships must adhere to specific shipping lanes or risk running afoul of spirit mines and other traps.

Today, the Valraean Protectorate remains at a chilly impasse with the Eternal Dominion of the sahuagin, as Valraea strengthes its defenses and the Dominion works to place ever more malenti agents within the Protectorate. Both refused to engage in direct commerce or diplomacy with each other, though the Dominion allows Aereni vessels to use their shipping lanes (at a price). Karakala serves as an intermediary between the two, carrying messages and conducting simple trade.

#### Valraean Adventures

Elves of the line of Valraea rarely leave the Protectorate. They have important duties to tend to, and issues in the surface world are generally dealt with by the elves of the island. However, the line of Valraea is devoted to the Undying Court, and an adventurer could be following a direct mandate either from the court itself or from a specific deathless sea elf. Such a character could use the sea elf racial traits from *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*; you might be a cleric using the Life or Knowledge domain, or a paladin following the Oath of the Ancients or the Oath of Devotion. In any case, this character would likely be proud; in your eyes, you're a celestial in the service of the divine.

Or you might be a sea elf who questions the traditions of the Protectorate. Perhaps you feel that the Protectorate--and Aerenal as a whole--should be emulating the spirit of innovation of the Five Nations rather than just holding to Aereni arcane traditions. As an artificer or wizard, you could be determined to study as many other systems of magic as possible; you don't believe that the defenses of the Protectorate will hold forever, and you want to develop something new.

Alternatively, you could play a locathah from the Valraean Protectorate (using the racial traits presented in *Locathah Rising*). Locathah are all but unknown on Khorvaire. As a Valraean locathah, you have the benefits of Aereni education, and may have adopted many elf mannerisms. Are you a proud champion of your nation and a loyal servant of the Undying Court? Or were you exiled after you opposed the Aereni oppression of your people? If so, are you acting in the interests of Valraean locathah now? Do you want to find a way for your people to develop their own deathless? Or are you following your own path in the world, leaving the Protectorate in your wake?

> ##### Sea Elves Beyond Valraea
>
>The line of Valraea are the sea elves of the Thunder Sea, but they aren't the only sea elves in Eberron. If you want to play a sea elf but don't want ties to the oppressive Protectorate, there are two additional options you can explore.
>
>***The Line of Maraen..*** The Valraean Protectorate guards the Thunder Sea and holds the line between Aerenal and the Thunder Sea. But that's not the only aquatic border of Aerenal. Along the eastern coastline, the elves of the line of Maraen are the sentinels of the Dragonreach. This isn't a colony, but rather, a military operation. In the wake of the last draconic incursion, Valraeans were conscripted to serve the Maraen line, but in the Dragonreach, they're not subjects, but soldiers and equals. Here, Maraen sea elves scout and fight alongside sahuagin and locathah. They hold firmly to the meritocratic principles that underlie Aerenal, and have formally adopted some of their non-elf soldiers into the line. They have yet to nominate a non-elf for admission into the Undying Court, but it's certainly a path they may pursue.

>***The Lhazaar Exiles..*** The conflict between the Undying Court and the line of Vol shook Aerenal. While most of the line of Valraea were staunch supporters of the Undying Court, there were some among both Valraea and Maraen who saw the persecution of Vol as unjust and fought against their kin. After Vol was defeated, they went into exile with other supporters of the line, traveling north to the Lhazaar Principalities. A few dwell off the coast of Farlnen, where they have adopted the necromantic traditions of the Bloodsails. The rest followed their elf kin to Orthoss, where they are a proud part of the Wind Whisperer principality.

#### Story Hooks

The Valraean Protectorate is an isolated part of a hidden nation. What could bring it into a story? Consider the following ideas.

***The Cold War.*** Whether on land or sea, adventurers could stumble into a Dominion plot to wreak havoc in the Protectorate. Thousands of innocents will die if they do nothing; what'll they do?

***Fish Farm.*** The adventurers are on a ship that is drawn off course (by hijackers? a freak occurrence?) and runs afoul of Valraean defenses, crippling the vessel. The characters are rescued by a group of Valraean locathah who maintain a farm on the edge of a small island. While waiting for someone to retrieve them, the adventurers get to know these locathah... and perhaps discover a dangerous secret hidden on the tiny island.

***Deathless for the People.*** A group of Valraean visionaries--locathah, sahuagin, and sympathetic sea elves--are determined to develop sahuagin or locathah deathless, their first step to establishing equality within the region. These revolutionaries are searching out scattered tombs that tie to the creation of deathless, along with artifacts that channel the power of Irian. Are their methods peaceful or violent? Will the adventurers assist them or oppose them?

***Dead or Alive?.*** To strengthen their support among the common people, the line of Valraea proclaims that a locathah hero has been raised to the Undying Court--the first non-elf to be admitted. But is this true, or is it a lie to placate the masses? The adventurers are hired to investigate, and if it's a hoax, to expose it. Are their patrons members of the locathah resistance, or might they be unknowingly working for the Eternal Dominion?

***The Quest for Hal'thela.*** The Protectorate is eager to tap the power and the potential of the kar'lassa, and the best candidate is Hal'thela--the kar'lassa bound to Thelanis. But the kar'lassa is deep behind enemy lines. Can the adventurers help find its location and lead a team there? Why do the sahuagin shun it? Is it simply that they can't control the capricious fey? Or is the entire region touched by a fey curse--something that must be lifted before anyone can explore it safely?

### Aboleths: The Darkest Depths

There are places where even sahuagin fear to swim. Like all the overlords, the Lurker in Shadow couldn't be destroyed, only imprisoned. It's bound in Khyber, deep below the center of the Thunder Sea. But there are passages to its prison spread across the region, in vast rifts and lightless tunnels. The servants of the Lurker linger in these places, building their strength and watching the world above.

The chief servants of the Lurker in Shadow are the aboleths. Though driven from the sea itself, they've maintained a shadow empire in the tunnels below the seabed. Across eras, they've collected their subjects--locathah, sahuagin, withered storm giants, people of the Five Nations stolen from their ships. Those aboleths with little interest in humanoids instead craft aberrations and monstrosities, like the chuul. While the aboleths have no direct ties to the Lords of Dust, there are fiends among their allies--shadow demons and other spirits created by the Lurker in Shadows.

The aboleths also possess untold riches and powerful artifacts from the Age of Demons--tools they can use to arm their allies, or to motivate with greed and bribery when direct mental domination isn't an option. The aboleths have risen en masse in the past, bringing down previous civilizations, fomenting war between the sahuagin and the giants. There have been dark centuries where the aboleths have ruled the sea--though these days were long before the rise of Galifar, and humanity knows little about the threat.

Today, the aboleths are spread across the ocean, and it's up to the DM to decide how powerful they are. Are they a hidden empire preparing to shake the world? Or are there just a few in hiding, preying on forgotten fishing villages and stealing thralls from shipwrecks? Consider the following ideas.

***The Pirate King.*** A new wave of piracy spreads across the trade lanes in the vicinity of Stormreach. The villain is Red Daskia, a Cloudreaver captain from the Lhazaar Principalities. But she has fiendish allies and artifacts from the Age of Demons that let her vessel outrun even Lyrandar vessels and disappear in fog. When the adventurers finally confront the pirate queen, it becomes clear that she's merely the agent of an aboleth mastermind; can the characters stop the true villain?

***Sahuagin Assault.*** The adventurers are caught in what seems to be a Dominion attack on a coastal community or peaceful vessel. An aboleth has seized control of a Dominion outpost and is seeking to cause conflict between the Dominion and the surface; it might also stage dryskin attacks on Dominion bases. Can the adventurers get to the bottom of it?

***Civil War in the Sea.***  A cabal of aboleths have gained control of the leaders of Hal'shavar. They use this power to foment unrest across the Dominion, turning city against city. These conflicts could spill out to peaceful travelers; a major assault could even affect Sharn or Stormreach. Could this bring down the entire Dominion? At first, the adventurers only encounter the side effects of the conflict, until a student of the Draconic Prophecy realizes that if the Dominion collapses, the Lurker in Shadow will be released. Can the adventurers end this civil war?

# Chapter 5: Planes of Existence

>>The sky was full of dreams. Countless points of light glittered against the endless darkness. But these were no stars. Some were quite close to Dela, and she could see them more clearly. There was movement within each iridescent sphere, images of people and places from across the world. In one, she could see a child begging on the streets of Sharn. In another, a woman was being crowned, surrounded by cheering people. Dela knew that if she touched one of these spheres, she would enter the dream, experiencing it just as if it was real. If she could find Rusty's dreams, she could speak to him. Try to save him. But how could she find one dream among the endless multitude?
>>
>>It was then that she saw the shadow moving against the darkness. Its body was nearly invisible against the sky, but it was surrounded by a halo of glowing eyes. Gentle had warned Dela about these. Each eye was the essence of a mortal; its dreams had been consumed by the kalaraq and its soul bound to service. And now, it was searching for her.

All mortals are connected on a spiritual level to Eberron's thirteen planes. This is most obvious with Dal Quor and Dolurrh. When (most) creatures sleep, their spirits are drawn to Dal Quor, where their dreams take shape. When creatures die, their souls are pulled to Dolurrh. These facts are obvious and indisputable. But many people don't realize that just like their spirits are pulled by Dolurrh and Dal Quor, they're similarly tied to all of the planes. A storyteller might be inspired by Thelanis without ever knowing it, while an artist's revelation may come from Xoriat, and a soldier's courage could flow from Shavarath. The basic energy of life itself flows into the world from Irian, while Mabar consumes both life and hope. These forces are everywhere, as much a part of the soul as gravity is part of the world.

This chapter examines each of the thirteen planes of Eberron, building on the information provided in chapter 4 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. It explores the basic concepts that define each plane and the ways that they can affect a story--whether as a destination for adventurers, or in the background, as forces shaping every moment of life.

## Eberron and Its Planes

Eberron's thirteen planes of existence enfold the Material Plane of Eberron itself. Though Eberron is part of a wider multiverse, it's completely cut off and has its own unique cosmology. Each of these thirteen planes have qualities of both Inner and Outer Planes as defined in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and affect the Material Plane in subtle and obvious ways. In addition to the constant influence of the planes on each creature, planes can also affect the world more directly, as seen in manifest zones and coterminous periods.

### About the Planes

The most important thing to understand about the planes is that they're *ideas*. Each one is a pure, iconic concept. War. Peace. Chaos. Order. They are eternal, and with few exceptions, unchanging. Eberron is the Material Plane, where these concepts come together and interact. It's a world that feels the passage of time, where life can change and evolve. The planes of Eberron are archetypal ideas. The precise details can change, but there's always been war in Shavarath, and always will be; that's what Shavarath is.

#### Universal Properties

If adventurers visit one of the planes, they'll find it has certain unnatural properties that can be felt consistently throughout the entire plane of existence. A plane's universal properties can often be felt on Eberron itself; one of the most common effects of manifest zones is to extend one or more of that plane's universal properties into the Material Plane, sometimes reliably, other times unpredictably. The section for each plane presents a list of universal effects that affect that entire plane; these generally apply to all creatures within that plane.

Time doesn't pass at the same rate on every plane; it could move faster, slower, or even unpredictably. For spells and similar effects that target oneself or require concentration, the duration is calculated based on the flow of time the caster is currently experiencing. If a spell doesn't require concentration and is cast on a target other than self (for example, a *geas* spell), its duration is based on the target's current plane and time.

#### Planar Denizens

Every plane's inhabitants are unique, but each creature can generally be classified in one of the following categories.

***Manifestations.*** A dragon rains fire down on a platoon of soldiers in Shavarath. Cheering crowds throng the streets of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Dragon, soldiers, crowds--none of these things are truly real. When you dream that you're taking a test at Arcanix, the sarcastic professor and mocking students aren't fully sentient spirits; they're manifestations of Dal Quor, created for that scene, and as soon as you wake, they'll vanish. These creatures can appear to be sentient, and you might be able to have a conversation with soldiers in Shavarath--but they won't have anything to say that you couldn't imagine coming out of the mouth of an extra in a war movie. As a general rule, manifestations can't leave the layers of the planes that they're in, and like dreams, they usually don't persist indefinitely; when their purpose is served, they simply evaporate until they're needed again. Very rarely, a manifestation might develop a more independent, sentient existence--like the drifters of Dal Quor--though they're generally still bound to their plane of origin and unable to deviate from their central purpose.

Manifestations vary by plane; in Dal Quor they're called figments, while in Shavarath, they're conscripts. In some planes, the manifestations are formed from the soul-stuff of mortals, while in others they're entirely imaginary. A plane never runs out of the potential for manifestations, but these creatures typically follow the internal logic of a scene. If you fight a dragon in Shavarath, it feels just like fighting an actual dragon, and when you kill it, it seems dead and you can enjoy your victory. However, if you return a day later, there's no sign of the corpse, and instead, there's a new dragon in the sky.

Some planes don't have manifestations of creatures, because the ideas they represent don't need them. Instead, these planes generally rely on native mortals to make up the supporting cast. So while Shavarath needs a constant churn of conscripts in battle, and Dal Quor creates figments to flesh out mortal dreams, other planes--Dolurrh, Fernia, Lamannia, and Syrania--don't create manifestations. For example, Lamannia needs mortal beasts to tell its story; birth, growth, and even death are part of its concept, and reflecting that requires a mortal population.

***Immortals.*** Immortal beings are an integral part of their native plane, each expressing a particular aspect of its core ideas. For example, in Shavarath, devils embody the concept of war fought in pursuit of tyranny, while angels are living symbols of the endless fight for justice. The name "immortal" doesn't mean "unkillable"--they can indeed be killed (as discussed in the "Killing Immortals" sidebar). While immortals don't show the effects of age, some have a limited lifespan and can die a natural death as well. However, their *essence* is immortal and their numbers remain constant.

Most immortals don't care about Eberron. Many consider Eberron to be an unfinished experiment, while their realm is the finished, perfected work of the Progenitors. Others simply believe in their purpose to the exclusion of all other things; to the angel of Shavarath, the eternal battle is the single most important struggle in the multiverse, and leaving their post for even an instant could give the enemy an advantage. So most immortals aren't concerned with the fates of mortals or their civilizations; of course mortals may die, that's their most defining feature. An angel has seen many human civilizations rise and fall--what's one more? While there are a few exceptions--immortals who chose to dwell on Eberron, whether to prey on mortals, observe them, or assist them--immortals are generally bound to their planes, and your problems are not their problems.

Immortals don't reproduce as mortal creatures do; if they're killed, their spiritual essence is instead reabsorbed into the plane and eventually reassembled. For example, in Shavarath, angels and devils are constantly being killed, but they're just as quickly being reborn to fight again. Immortals are each born as embodiments of specific ideas and don't choose their path; they're already mature, possessing their full abilities and knowledge, and imbued with an absolute understanding of their purpose. So while immortals possess great power, they lack the potential of mortals to grow and evolve, and find the idea of questioning their beliefs or straying from their purpose to be inconceivable.

> ##### Killing Immortals
>
>Killing an immortal being is a temporary solution. Immortals that play a particularly significant role within a plane often return with their memories and personality intact; physical destruction is no more than a short trip to the penalty box. Lesser immortals may return with the same abilities, but with a new appearance, memories, or personality. The number of immortals remains the same, but it's a new incarnation of the idea. The only way to permanently eliminate an immortal is to somehow contain or redirect its spiritual essence; this is why the Silver Flame bound the overlords instead of destroying them.
>
>While immortals can't be destroyed, it's possible that the manner of a creature's death, or circumstances that follow, could delay the return of a particular immortal, or force it to return as a new incarnation instead of retaining its memories. The DM could choose to make these general rules for a type of creature--perhaps immortals from Shavarath return in 24 hours if they're killed on Shavarath, but it takes 6 months for them to return if they're killed on Eberron. Or it could be extremely specific: the devil Hashtorak returns within a day of his death, but if he's killed with the Spear of Miron he'll be banished for ten years.
>

There are exceptions to all rules, of course. The kalashtar exist because a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar. Likewise, radiant idols are angels of Syrania that were corrupted by their time on the Material Plane and desired mortal adoration. But these examples are vanishingly rare. Sometimes it's because the unusual immortal is born embodying a unique perspective on the usual concept; this is essentially a mutation, as opposed to a choice. In other cases, an outside force might change or corrupt the immortal's fundamental nature. And rarely, an immortal might have an unusual sense of identity and the ability to choose.

If an immortal changes in a way that alters its core concept, this is often accompanied by a physical transformation, such as a corrupted angel becoming a radiant idol, thus losing its ability to fly. Immortals may be able to increase their abilities by absorbing other immortals, acquiring artifacts, or through other means unique to their plane. They simply don't grow or gain experience through time alone; after all, some of them are as old as the universe itself, and in the absence of a dramatic cause, they're utterly unchanging.

***Mortals.*** Mortal creatures live in the planes, but they're much like their counterparts in Eberron. They have families and children, and can live quiet lives or be driven by grand ambitions. Unlike manifestations and immortals, mortal creatures can evolve and change their ways, and of course, they can die. In some planes, mortals are either subjugated by immortals or voluntarily serve them; in others, they pursue their own paths. In some cases--such as the merfolk of Lamannia or the eladrin of Thelanis--these creatures are natives of their home plane, were created by it, and have always been a part of it. Others--such as the frost giants of Risia--originally came from the Material Plane and simply carved out a place in their new plane. These non-native mortals may have lived in the planes for many generations, but on a fundamental level, they aren't truly a part of it.

***Planar Variations.*** The same type of creature can appear in different planes--demons can be found in Fernia, Dolurrh, Shavarath, and more. They might use the same statistics, but their appearance and motivations vary dramatically based on their planes, and they have no sense that being "demons" makes them all allies. The balor of Shavarath embodies the savagery of war; its wings are of steel, and blood drips from its notched sword. The balor of Fernia represents the terrifying destructive power of fire; its wings and sword are made of pure flame. With any planar creature--especially immortals--consider the idea it represents and how that can be uniquely embodied.

#### Planar Layers

Eberron is the Material Plane, bound by the logical limitations that govern material things. However, its thirteen planes are ideas, and these are potentially limitless. With this in mind, the planes of Eberron are divided into layers--distinct environments or realms that aren't bound by the laws of physical space nor physically connected. These layers can be tiny, seemingly infinite, or anything in between. A desert may wrap back upon itself, the alleys in a city could twist in impossible ways to always return you to the main square, or you could come to an absolute edge, where everything falls away into an endless void.

Many scholars--including Dorius Alyre ir'Korran in his celebrated *Planar Codex*--describe the layers of a plane as a stack; however, the planes of Eberron aren't physically arranged in a particular order, and there's no concept of a top or bottom layer. Instead, each layer explores a different facet of the core concept that defines the plane. Lamannia is the Plane of Nature, and each layer showcases a particular environment--there's an endless ocean, a vast forest, a volcano forever on the edge of erupting. Shavarath is the Plane of War, and each layer contains a different aspect of war--a bitter siege, a bloody melee, a lingering guerilla conflict. Some planes have a core layer that serves as the heart of the plane, such as the Amaranthine Cities of Mabar and Irian. But the layers of Lamannia are all equal in importance.

While they aren't stacked, most planes have layers bound by a reliable set of connections. The shape of these connections varies based on the plane. Some are obvious: a massive door sitting in the desert, a pool that reflects a scene from another layer. Others are more subtle; if you come upon an island while sailing on the Endless Ocean of Lamannia and you walk inland, you'll find that the island is a completely different layer--and when you turn around, the ocean is no longer behind you. A portal doesn't have to be physical at all; in Thelanis, you can travel to a new layer by acting out the elements of a new story.

This chapter provides examples of notable layers for each plane, but these are only a sampling. Just as ideas have no limits, there are no limits on the number of layers a plane can contain. In developing or describing a layer to fit your story, keep the core concept of the plane in mind. What differentiates the vast fortress citadel of Irian's Amaranthine City from a fortress in Shavarath? A fortress in Shavarath is about war; the stones are worn, and there's a scent of blood and smoke in the air. In Irian, the fortress is a symbol of hope, of an empire on the rise; it's bright, clean, and may have never seen an actual battle. So while the layers of two planes might initially sound similar, look back to the core concept and consider how that's reflected in each layer.

### The Material Plane

Though travel to the planes is usually quite challenging and dangerous, even adventures on the world of Eberron can be profoundly impacted by the planes that lie beyond. This section discusses some unique aspects of the Material Plane and its place in the wider cosmology of Eberron.

#### Planar Manifestations

Even without planar travel, there are many ways the planes can manifest in an adventure. This chapter examines these potential impacts for each plane using three general categories.

***Manifest Zones.*** These are places where the influence of a plane can be directly felt in the Material Plane. Each manifest zone is tied to a particular physical location on the Material Plane; this is true not only for the Eberron side of the zone, but for the region of the other plane it connects to. So if you live near a manifest zone to Thelanis, it always connects to a specific location in that plane; it's not simply a manifest zone to Thelanis, it's a manifest zone to a particular region of the Endless Weald (or any other layer of the plane).

Manifest zones often exhibit one or more of the universal properties of a plane; in a weak manifest zone, their effect might be diminished, and in a strong one, multiple effects might be present. Chapter 4 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* suggests more possible features of manifest zones beyond those presented in this chapter. Some manifest zones can serve as direct portals between Eberron and another plane (though travel is blocked to Dal Quor and Xoriat). Most portals only open under certain circumstances--often when the planes are coterminous, when the moon associated with that plane is full, or both. These gateways can allow adventurers to travel to another plane--but can also be the source of unexpected, and sometimes hostile, creatures from other planes.

> ##### Kar'lassa Dreams
>
>Chapter 4 describes the kar'lassa, massive monstrosities that serve as living conduits to the planes. The kar'lassa are asleep, but they dream in planes other than Dal Quor, and mortal creatures that sleep in their vicinity are drawn into these dreams. Kar'lassa dreams exist as a unique layer within the plane, blending the plane's core principles with the alien consciousness of the dreamer; it's up to the DM to decide exactly how this manifests and how easy it is to reach other layers in the plane. Where the sahuagin have established a connection to a kar'lassa--as described in chapter 4--they've created a temple in its dreams, tended by dream priests.
>

***Coterminous and Remote.*** The planes of Eberron are often depicted as orbiting the Material Plane, reflecting the fact that they move into and out of alignment with it. When a plane is *coterminous*, it's aligned; the plane's influence grows over the entire world, and it amplifies the effects of existing manifest zones. On the other hand, when a plane is *remote*, its power fades; since the planes are always influencing the Material in subtle ways, their absence impacts the world as strongly as their presence does. Multiple planes can be coterminous at the same time; these planar conjunctions are often related to the interactions of the moons, and characters proficient in Arcana can usually work out upcoming conjunctions.

These planar cycles are intended as plot devices, so DMs don't need to run them on strict calendar cycles. Instead, use them to suit the story. They can add an interesting mechanical twist to an adventure: because Mabar is coterminous, all undead are stronger! They can drive a villain's plot: *Lady Illmarrow must be stopped from activating the device in three days' time, when both Mabar and Dolurrh are coterminous--a conjunction that won't happen again for another century!*

It's ultimately up to the DM to decide when planes are coterminous or remote. If it suits the story for Dolurrh to be remote for the next three days, make it so--just be sure to inform the arcane scholars among the adventurers, who'd likely know such a thing in advance. Other DMs might prefer to have concretely established cycles, which can add their own interesting flavor to an adventure. For example, Mabar is always coterminous on the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice, a time known as Long Shadows. On these nights, friends and family gather together and keep lights burning through the night. With this in mind, this chapter does discuss the traditional cycle of each plane, when it's reliably coterminous or remote--just remember the cycles are there to enhance your story, not limit it!

***Artifacts.*** The planes can be an excellent source of unusual materials, legendary magic items, and relics. Each section discusses a few kinds of items that could come from each plane and its associated manifest zones.

#### The Skies of Eberron

In the myth of the Progenitors, Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber worked together to create the thirteen planes. Following this effort, they rested in the emptiness that lies at the center of the planes--and there, they quarreled. Khyber killed Siberys and tore him apart, then Eberron enfolded Khyber and became a living prison, forming the world itself.

This could be literal truth. Perhaps the ring in the sky was once the body of a great cosmic wyrm. But even if it's not literally true, it reflects truths about the world. From the surface, Eberron looks much like Earth; there is soil below your feet and moons and stars above. But the fact is that Eberron is *not* like Earth, and much of what can be seen isn't what it appears to be. As far as anyone has determined, Eberron is the sole planet in its Material Plane, and the fulcrum where the thirteen planes come together. Go below the surface of Eberron and you find not a molten core, but the demiplanes of Khyber. So what are the celestial bodies of Eberron?

***The Ring of Siberys.*** This brilliant equatorial band of light dominates the sky. Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, and its golden color suggests that the entire ring may be comprised of these magical crystals. The Siberyan Theory, as taught at Arcanix and the Arcane Congress, postulates that all arcane magic manipulates energy that radiates from the Ring--and magic itself is the Blood of Siberys.

***The Sun.*** In the Progenitor myth, the three rested in the Material Plane after creating the planes. They created the sun, Arrah, much as mortals might kindle a campfire. This fire remained even after their battle, and continues to provide light, heat, and comfort to the world, functioning much like the sun we're used to in our own world. In the Sovereign Host, Dol Arrah is the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice; her name is, essentially, Warrior Sun.

***The Stars.*** There are stars in the sky of Eberron, but they aren't the anchors of distant solar systems. There are limits to the Material Plane, and the stars mark those limits; think of them as glittering points in a crystal sphere. The common constellations are figures of ancient dragons--Io, Tiamat, Chronepsis--though most people couldn't actually say where these names come from. It's generally assumed that they were handed down by one of the ancient kingdoms of Sarlona, or established by the ancestors of the Aereni--but in fact, the names are from a tradition spread by the sages of Argonnessen.

***The Moons.*** Twelve orbiting moons are visible from Eberron--the former moon, Crya, hasn't been seen since ancient times, when tales say the empire of the giants destroyed it. Each moon goes through standard lunar phases, but during the month that shares its name, the moon enters an ascendant phase; during this time, the moon is brighter than usual. Each moon is associated with certain personality traits, and it's believed that people are influenced by the moon that's ascendant at the time of their birth. But there's a further complication, because the moons are also tied to the planes, as indicated on the Planar Destinations and Moons table. Each moon enters an additional ascendant phase whenever its associated plane is coterminous, and becomes unusually dim when the plane is remote. So while unusual, it's possible for there to be two or three ascendant moons at a time if multiple coterminous periods converge.

The connection between the planes and moons is reinforced by the fact that while on a plane, its associated moon is the only one that can be seen in the sky (though not all planar layers have a visible sky, like the dismal caverns of Dolurrh). While on a moon's associated plane, the phase of the moon doesn't necessarily match its current phase on Eberron. It may be fixed in a single phase--such as in Lamannia, where the moon is always full--or its phase might even change from layer to layer. While on a plane, if the moon is visible, it can be identified with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Nature) check.

To date, no humanoids have visited one of the moons. Because of this, their true nature remains a mystery. It's possible that they are orbiting, habitable planetoids, home to exotic creatures and valuable resources. But some sages believe that they aren't actually physical bodies at all, but rather, planar gateways--if an airship were to somehow fly high enough and attempt to land on a moon, perhaps it would instead pass into the sky of the associated plane. Determining the truth would be an epic adventure.

> ##### What about the Soverigns?
>
>The Sovereigns don't dwell in the planes, and the people of Eberron don't expect them to. Vassals of the Sovereign Host believe that the Sovereigns are everywhere at once. Onatar isn't working at a forge in Fernia, he's with every smith at *every* forge. Many Vassals believe that when mortal souls pass through Dolurrh, they join the Sovereigns, but this is seen more as an ecstatic union rather than joining them in an existential clubhouse.
>
>Some immortals in the planes honor the Sovereigns. A platoon of angels in Shavarath may carry the banner of Dol Arrah, while a squad of demons wear the skins of their foes and howl praise to the Mockery. The Librarian of Dolurrh may mention the time Aureon came to borrow a book--but that was almost a hundred thousand years ago. These acknowledgments don't prove anything, other than confirming the most basic myths of the Sovereign Host: that in the first age of the world, a band of champions defeated the overlords, as discussed in chapter 1. It's possible that they ascended and became the omnipresent entities many believe them to be, but that's the part that even angels must take on faith.
>

### The Astral and Ethereal Planes

The Astral and Ethereal Planes are discussed in chapter 2 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. The githyanki's vast ships can be found in the Astral Plane, as discussed in the section on Kythri.

It's possible that adventurers on either of these transitive planes may discover portals that lead back to the Material Plane or to twelve of Eberron's other planes; however, Dal Quor hasn't been accessible since the Age of Giants, and portals to this plane are impassable. The destination of Astral color pools and Ethereal curtains can be determined by their color; each portal closely resembles the appearance of the moon tied to that plane, as indicated in the Planar Destinations and Moons table.

## Khyber: The Worlds within the World

Adventurers don't have to go beyond Eberron to find strange and magical realms. A layer of stone and soil lies beneath the surface of Eberron, and those who delve below may find natural caverns, subterranean ruins of Dhakaani goblinoids, or the realm of the dwarves of Sol Udar. But there's more to Khyber than rock and mud. The underdark contains countless demiplanes--pockets of space where the rules that govern the Material Plane don't apply. These are the source of Khyber's most unnatural aspects, where its fiends are formed and where the daelkyr remain imprisoned in their own layers (similar to the layers of Eberron's other planes). Demiplanes can be deadly, but they can also provide an unexpected opportunity for exploration and the discovery of wondrous new worlds just below the surface.

The Realm Below section of chapter 4 provides ideas of what it can be like to explore the upper regions of Khyber; this section gives an overview of the demiplanes adventurers might encounter as they delve deeper.

### What are Demiplanes?

The demiplanes of Khyber are somewhat like the layers of other planes. Each demiplane has limited space, though it could be as small as a house or as large as a nation. Its borders might be defined by impassible physical barriers or walls of force, or the pocket of space could wrap around--if you walk far enough in one direction, you'll find you've looped back to where you began.

Reaching a demiplane requires a portal. In some cases, travel also requires rituals or planar conjunctions, and some portals may be impassable, sealed by the ancient wards of dragons or Gatekeeper druids. However, many portals are not only active, but nearly imperceptible; adventurers walking down a tunnel may pass through a portal to the Ironlands without ever knowing it. Portals are static, remaining in one place, and as long as one remains open, adventurers can always retrace their steps to return to it.

Demiplanes may have two or more portals, each leading to anywhere on the Material Plane. The realm of Dyrrn the Corruptor has portals beneath the Shadow Marches and the Ironroot Mountains, while both the Kech Shaarat goblinoids of Darguun and the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes make use of portals tied to the Ironlands. As such, demiplanes can allow rapid travel across long distances; adventurers could enter a demiplane below Q'barra, walk what seems like only a mile, then emerge from a tunnel into Breland. Demiplanes have much in common with Eberron's thirteen planes. Natural laws may not apply within, and time, space, or other elements may behave in unnatural ways. A demiplane could have some of the properties of another plane, like the Burning Bright property of Fernia or the Primordial Matter property of Lamannia. But there's no universal theme that unites all demiplanes; each one is entirely unique. Some sages say that these demiplanes are Khyber's dreams. Others believe that demiplanes are unfinished ideas--early drafts of reality or seeds that never quite became planes.

While demiplanes are usually limited in size, there's no inherent logic to their construction. It's possible to be a mile below the surface of Eberron when you discover a valley that appears to be open to the sky... but it's not the sky of Eberron! Unlike the planes, the demiplanes of Khyber don't contain any of Eberron's celestial objects--there could be moons, rings, even suns in the sky, but they'll be entirely unfamiliar.

While there's no common theme that unites all demiplanes, there are three common categories of demiplane: hearts, prisons, and shadows.

### Heart Demiplanes

The overlords--**Rak Tulkhesh**, **Sul Khatesh**, and others--are said to be Khyber's first children. They were the first fiends to physically manifest, and each overlord brought forth a host of lesser fiends. When a fiend dies, its essence returns to Khyber. Each one is bound to and reincarnated in a particular demiplane within Khyber--the heart of an overlord. This is one reason the overlords can't be permanently destroyed; each is part of the architecture of Khyber itself, and the overlord's form that can be encountered in Eberron is simply a projection of its essence. To defeat the overlords, the champions of the Age of Demons used the Silver Flame to bind their immortal essence, preventing them from returning to their heart demiplane to reform. This essentially severed the brain from the heart--but the heart demiplanes still exist. The lesser servants of the overlord--its rakshasa and other fiend minions--return to the heart when they reform, and should an overlord's bonds be broken, it will recover its full strength in its heart realm.

Heart demiplanes are relatively small, around the size of a large city. Each reflects the overlord it's tied to in appearance and properties. Just as the shard-prison of an overlord's spirit can affect a region, portals to a heart realm often affect the surrounding area; what's believed to be a manifest zone to Shavarath might instead be a portal to the Bitter Shield. While the overlords aren't consciously present in their hearts, their essences still permeate them. Heart realms are typically inhabited by a host of lesser fiends bound to that overlord. Many have no desire to return to Eberron until their overlords are free, while others serve in the Lords of Dust, using the heart as a refuge. A couple hearts are described below, but there are at least thirty--one for each overlord.

#### The Bitter Shield: Rak Tulkhesh

Rak Tulkhesh's heart is a crimson fortress, with stones soaked in blood and walls studded with rusted iron spikes. Around the tower's base, rakshasas and other fiends endlessly battle, their pointless struggle reflecting the bloodlust of their master. Mordakhesh the Shadowsword often returns to the Bitter Shield between schemes, and is hailed as lord of the fortress.

The Bitter Shield has the Unquenchable Fury and Bloodletting properties of Shavarath.

#### The Tower of Shadows: Sul Khatesh

The heart of Sul Khatesh is a tower built from black stone traced with silver. It glitters in the light of three unfamiliar crescent moons. Here, it's always night, and the servants of the Keeper of Secrets sing paeans to the moons as they perform bloody sacrifices and trace eldritch symbols in the soil. The tower holds a library of dark secrets, and beside it, a scriptorium where fiends scribe the books of shadows that may be given to mortal warlocks. Beneath the city of Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes lies a portal to the Tower of Shadows, and the rakshasa Hektula dwells here when she's not tending to the library of Ashtakala.

The Tower of Shadows has the Universal Understanding property of Syrania and the Eternal Shadows property of Mabar.

### Prison Demiplanes

When something is described as being "trapped in Khyber," it usually means it's trapped in a demiplane somewhere in Khyber. The most infamous prisoners of Khyber are the daelkyr, but there may well be others--either immortal spirits or mortal creatures that were trapped in the demiplane by their enemies.

Dyrrn the Corruptor dwells in the Palace of Sinew, and Belashyrra in the Citadel of Lidless Eyes (both are described in *Eberron: Rising From The Last War*). Valaara is bound in the Deepest Hive, described in chapter 8 of this book. It's said that the daelkyr Orlassk dwells in a fortress carved into a giant gargoyle that roams the tunnels of Khyber; it could be that the gargoyle exists in Orlassk's prison realm, or perhaps the massive creature contains a portal to its prison.

When dealing with a prison demiplane, the DM will have to decide the limitations of the portals. In the case of the daelkyr demiplanes, the daelkyr can't leave them, but other creatures can freely enter or depart. So Dyrrn's minions can swarm out of the Palace of Sinew, but as long as the Gatekeepers' seals remain intact, Dyrrn itself cannot leave. The nature of the binding and the power of the daelkyr is such that they have shaped their demiplanes in their image, but lesser creatures could be trapped in more traditional prisons.

### Shadow Demiplanes

Unlike heart and prison demiplanes, shadow demiplanes serve no clear purpose. They aren't prisons or fortresses of evil, but rather, strange reflections of the world. Much like Xoriat, they often defy natural logic--and this often gives them great value. Beneath the Ironroot Mountains in the Realm Below, the dwarves found a realm where precious stones grow on trees. In the Vale of the Inner Sun, creatures don't age.

Many sages call these "shadow demiplanes" because many seem to be shadows of other planes; the Abyssal Forest of Khaar is a reflection of Lamannia, while the Ironlands bears some resemblance to Shavarath. But in fact, demiplanes of Khyber have no ties to the other planes, nor are they touched by the natural influence of Eberron or the celestial light of Siberys. Perhaps the concepts woven into these demiplanes are echoes of Khyber's dreams or hints of what might have been... or perhaps their resemblance is inexplicable coincidence.

Shadow realms may hold important resources that can be used or harvested--but these regions always have a malevolent aspect. Fiends are common, and even mortal creatures that dwell there are sinister. Remaining in a shadow realm for too long is usually an invitation to corruption. There are countless shadow demiplanes, some small and others vast; those mentioned here are just a few examples.

#### The Abyssal Forest of Khaar

At first glance, this seems a primeval forest, but on closer inspection, it's filled with horrors. The demiplane is tangled in crimson vines filled with blood. It teems with monstrosities, twisted beasts that aren't as alien as the aberrations of the daelkyr, but just as deadly; even its most charming songbirds are carnivorous and cruel. The forest's strange vegetation can be used to make potions or deadly poisons, valuable resources--for those willing to brave its horrors. While in the Abyssal Forest of Khaar, any creature that's not naturally immune to poison damage becomes vulnerable to poison damage, and it has disadvantage on saving throws against poison.

#### The Ironlands

This realm's entire landscape is formed from metal. Adamantine trees grow razor-sharp leaves, and iron blades of grass cut through soft shoes. This demiplane, which has Shavarath's Bloodletting property, is home to bands of devils and demons that engage in their own endless wars. These fiends enjoy fighting and oppressing mortals, but fortunately, they can't leave their realm. The Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes raid the Ironlands, pillaging weapons from the warrior fiends. The Kech Shaarat (see chapter 4) have expanded their deep vault into the Ironlands; over many centuries, these dar have established an alliance with one of the devil clans, allowing them to hold onto this territory. It's up to the DM to decide on the foundation of this alliance and whether the Shaarat can leverage it in other ways.

#### The Vale of the Inner Sun

A widespread cult of the Dragon Below believes that there is a paradise within Khyber, a place free from suffering and death. The Vale of the Inner Sun does exist, and it has the Stillness of Flesh property of Risia and the Light of Life property of Irian. However, there is a price to this immortality; creatures who dwell in the Vale for an extended time become slowly mutated, eventually turning into unique aberrations. The inhabitants of the Vale--some of whom have been there for centuries--have no love of outsiders, and visitors must prove their worth to bathe in the prismatic light of the Inner Sun.

> ##### House Orien and Demiplanes
>
>Demiplanes can serve as wormholes to distant locations--a valuable means of transporting people and goods! Orien has discovered one such passage; its enclaves in the cities of Passage (in Aundair) and Varna (in the Eldeen Reaches) are built above portals that connect to a tiny, safe shadow demiplane. This allows Orien to move between these two cities within minutes. However, the two cities are already close and well connected, so this has remained a secret resource instead of being put to widespread commercial use.
>
>Recently, however, the war and the Mourning have disrupted many of Orien's trade routes, and the development of the airship is threatening the house's dominance of overland travel. Desperate to regain security, Baron Kwanti d'Orien is actively searching for new demiplane channels. He dreams of finding a route providing safe, swift passage across the Mournland, which could become an Orien commercial route or even carry a lightning rail. But Kwanti has no idea just how dangerous demiplanes can be, and in these efforts, he could easily open doors that should've been left closed.

## Daanvi: The Perfect Order

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/149%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

There's a rhythm to Daanvi, a subtle metronome keeping perfect time. If you act without thinking, you unconsciously move to the beat. The streets may be crowded, but everyone walks at the same pace, every foot striking the ground at the same moment. It takes a conscious effort to break this rhythm, change the pattern, stand out from the crowd. Your instincts push you to fall in line, match the pattern, be part of the great machine.

This is Daanvi, the Perfect Order. It represents the triumph of law over lawlessness, of discipline over chaos. From the perfectly structured insect hives to the inevitable tribunals that judge every mortal action, this is a triumph of order. On the one hand, Daanvi shows how structure and discipline can create enduring systems, and how laws are the backbone of prosperous civilization. On the other hand, it can crush individuality and innovation. It shows that laws can serve justice, but they can also pose an endless series of obstacles, or even be the tools of tyrants. Daanvi encompasses all of these paths. It shows the benefits of law and order--and the risks of taking them too far.

#### Universal Properties

The impulse toward order affects all creatures in Daanvi. It's impossible to knowingly lie while in Daanvi, and the effects of random chance are reduced. In Daanvi, all things are inherently reliable--remarkable fortune and bad luck are equally rare.

***Plane of Truth.*** A creature can't tell a deliberate lie. It can avoid answering questions, or be evasive in its answers, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

***Impeded Illusion.*** When a creature casts an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is halved.

***The Eyes of the Law.*** When a creature casts a divination spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.

***No Chance.*** The first time in a round (or any time outside of combat) that a creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw (other than a death saving throw), treat the roll as a 10. If the creature has advantage or disadvantage on that roll, it only rolls one die, and treats the other one as a 10.

***Flowing Time.*** For every 10 minutes that pass in Daanvi, only 1 minute passes in the Material Plane. So if a creature spends 10 days arguing a case before a Daanvian court, less than a day has passed on Eberron.

### Denizens

All denizens of Daanvi either embody the concept of law and order or exist to be bound by it. Most modrons, angels, and devils perform administrative tasks as they serve as cogs in the grand machinery of their plane. Nearly all of Daanvi's inhabitants follow an unvarying daily cycle, each denizen limited by its jurisdiction. Some authorities can move freely and enforce laws in multiple layers. But a deva can't take action in the Iron Ward, even if it feels that an adventurer is suffering injustice, because that ward is under the jurisdiction of the local devils.

The angels and devils of Daanvi use normal statistics, but their appearance is similar to modrons and inevitables. They might have metallic skin or wings, or even look like living constructs. These immortals are creatures of absolute law and can't be compelled to break it or act against their nature. All celestials and fiends of Daanvi possess the following Axiomatic Mind trait:

***Axiomatic Mind..*** The creature can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or instructions.

Daanvi doesn't have a significant population of mortals, though there are other immortals in Daanvi beyond those explored by this section, each one representing a facet of the plane; for example, ant-like formians inhabit numerous layers of their own.

#### Modrons and Inevitables

**Modrons**, Daanvi's most common inhabitants, are embodiments of pure law, with no bias toward justice or oppression. They do their assigned tasks and obey every law; nothing more, nothing less. Monodrones can be found in many layers performing the most basic tasks. More sophisticated modrons perform endless administrative tasks and enforce basic laws.

**Inevitables** are powerful constructs dedicated to enforcing the law in all its aspects. Mighty maruts can be assigned to enforce specific contracts; note that these maruts have nothing to do with their counterparts in Dolurrh, just as the devils of Daanvi aren't related to those in Shavarath. The Justify trait of Daanvian maruts transports victims to the Hall of Justice in Daanvi.

In addition to the modrons and inevitables presented in the *Monster Manual* and *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*, all of which are found in Daanvi, there are others that serve specific tasks within the plane. In particular, an entity known as the Kolyarut resides beneath the Hall of Justice, with absolute authority over enforcing the law. The Kolyarut acts through a legion of host bodies, one of which serves on every inevitable tribunal; these beings are also called Kolyarut, though they're only representatives of the greater force.

#### Angels

The angels of Daanvi represent law in the service of justice and the greater good. These immortals enforce the laws, but also do their best to act fairly and to see that justice is done. While angels have duties to attend to and rarely have time to simply chat with random mortals, they're typically kind and helpful when they do have time. They believe with all their being that law and civilization are the most vital virtues of all, and that the law can't be set aside for any reason.

**Devas** and other angels of similar power are local authorities. They can be found as ministers, magistrates, and sages. A deva may be appointed to serve as a counselor for mortals called before an inevitable tribunal. The devas at the Infinite Archive serve as sages; modrons file and record, but the devas study the data and reflect on it. Meanwhile, powerful planetars serve as high ministers and guardians of important gates and sites.

Solars dwell in the Panopticon. There are thirteen solars, each assigned to monitor and administer justice within one of Eberron's planes (though no solar holds dominion over the Material Plane). However, there are a host of restrictions on how and when they may act. Typically, a solar must be invoked by a legitimate authority within the plane in question--so while Hazariel, the Solar of Syrania, is usually called in to cast down radiant idols, Azazar, the Solar of Xoriat, has never yet been called on by that plane. Until called, they watch; while in the Panopticon, solars can observe anything that occurs in the plane of their dominion. Shortly before the shift of the Quor Tarai that produced il-Lashtavar, Tyrala, the Solar of Dal Quor, went to investigate the actions that resulted in Dal Quor being thrown off its planar axis; she hasn't been seen since.

#### Devils

The devils of Daanvi represent law in the service of tyranny and personal gain. In essence, they depict the danger of laws and how order can become an oppressive force. While the angels and devils of Daanvi despise one another, the strict laws determining jurisdiction mean that they rarely come into contact and almost never engage in combat--though it's common for a devil and an angel to be found in opposite positions arguing a case before an inevitable tribunal in the Hall of Justice.

Most often, devils are found in layers such as the Iron Ward, where they're cruel enforcers and tyrants. They can be encountered as guardians and sentinels, though they're invariably too harsh when it comes to performing their duties. Other devils seek to exploit loopholes and use the law to their advantage, extorting adventurers or otherwise using the law as a weapon. Orthons and erinyes apprehend lawbreakers, while pit fiends serve as executioners in the Hall of Justice.

#### Subjects

Every tyrant needs people to oppress, while every utopian society needs people to enjoy its just laws. The countless manifestations of Daanvi, called subjects, serve this purpose. They're humanoid, but their shape is indistinct. They provide the *impression* of a person--someone completely normal and unremarkable, often of the same species as the viewer--but no matter how hard anyone tries, it's impossible to actually focus on them. Conversations with subjects are surface-level at best, with no distinct personality or goals. Subjects pose no threat in combat, and are dispersed if they suffer any damage, only to reform within a few minutes.

### Layers

Daanvi is home to hundreds of layers, and each is a metaphor for a particular aspect of order or civilization. Time is consistent across all layers, though in some, denizens work at all hours, while in others, there are strict regulations about what times certain activities are allowed. Daanvi has its own calendar, but denizens can easily translate it to the standard calendar of Galifar (or any other system) when dealing with visiting mortals.

Traveling to Daanvi using plane shift or similar abilities takes you to the Prime Gate. The portals between layers are clearly labeled and easily found, with angelic guides happy to provide assistance. Lesser portals are guarded by modrons, while major portals may be maintained by a horned devil or planetar. Travel passes can be obtained at the Prime Gate, though violating local ordinances can result in a revoked travel pass.

While some rules--such as the system of gateways and travel passes--are universal, every layer has its own distinct laws. Often these are typical--no theft, no assault except in selfdefense. However, layers may have unusual ordinances--no spellcasting illusion magic after noon. The scope of laws, punishment, and enforcement vary considerably based on the oppressiveness of the layer; is it generally just (administered by angels), even-handed (modrons), or oppressive (devils)? In gentler layers, lawbreakers receive an instructive warning from an angel; those in harsher layers aren't so lucky. In some cases, guardians administer an immediate punishment, as discussed in the "Daanvian Judgment" sidebar. More serious offenders may be taken to the Hall of Justice to face an inevitable tribunal.

> ##### Daanvian Judgement
>
>What happens when characters break the laws of Daanvi? In theory, there's an incredibly complex Code of Justice that the Kolyarut uses to determine the ideal punishment. In practice, the punishment should fit the crime, but it depends on the district where the judgment takes place. An angel upholds the law but seeks to ensure that the punishment truly is fair; a devil may use the threat of a disproportionate punishment (entirely legitimate by the Code of Justice, of course) to drive extortion.
>
>Physical punishments are possible, from beating to maiming (such as the loss of an eye or tongue) to execution. Such punishments are most common in oppressive layers. Imprisonment is rare, but possible, either in a local cell or the Inescapable Prison. Because of the flowing time of Daanvi, a hundred years in a Daanvi cell is only ten years on Eberron.
>
>Fines are common, not because Daanvi needs revenue, but because it's easily adjusted to the individual. Fines like gold or property can be taken immediately, or future earnings might be garnished; perhaps half of all gold the character acquires immediately vanishes until the fine has been paid. Another common punishment is the *judgment tattoo*, a complex marking placed across the victim's face that can't be removed by any power short of a *wish* spell. Any creature that speaks a language can magically understand its meaning, conveyed in a simple concept like MURDERER or THIEF. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows a character to identify it as a *judgment tattoo* from Daanvi.
>
>Other magical punishments could be imposed. The offender could experience the effects of *bestow curse* for a year or a lifetime. A liar could be unable to tell a lie for a year (though they can be evasive in their answers). A convict could be stripped of a particular talent, taking disadvantage on a specific skill check during their the sentence. They could be stripped of fame, and no one will give the victim credit for positive actions, though they can still receive blame for misdeeds. There are few limits on what an inevitable tribunal can do, and undoing such a judgment requires the power of a *wish*.
>

Some of Daanvi's most noteworthy layers are described below; other layers each express some form of order of civilization, though most are of little interest to adventurers. There are examples of utopian governance, mob justice, and countless other examples of law at work. The Perfect Grange is a vast, precisely maintained farm, displaying the virtues of agricultural discipline. Hive 43 is a formian settlement where immortal ant-like spirits care for their queen; if that doesn't strike your fancy, maybe one of the other 42 hives will!

#### The Prime Gate

Imagine Terminus Station in Sharn, but instead of skycoaches and rail tickets, portals lead to different layers. Hundreds of subjects and modrons mill about, standing in orderly queues as they wait to pass through a portal. By Daanvian law, all travelers must pass through the Prime Gate, where plane shift and astral travel deposit adventurers. If people enter Daanvi through some other means, they're in violation of the law--never a good idea.

While the Prime Gate's bustling appearance suggests Daanvi is as welcoming to travelers as Syrania, most traffic consists of local commuters moving between layers. Extraplanar visitors must acquire travel passes from the Passage Authority; how difficult this is depends on the tone of the Authority when you arrive... and this shifts from day to day. If the Authority is just, the angels keep it moving quickly and smoothly; as long as you truly have a valid reason for your travel, you should be able to pass. If the Authority is even-handed, it's managed by modrons; it's possible to get through, but there are immense lines and a lot of redundant paperwork. In addition to having a clearly stated reason for travel, Modrons might only provide access to specific layers, or impose restrictions--"You'll have to drink that potion now or throw it away." And if the Authority is oppressive that day, the devils on duty make it a living hell; the question is whether they're more interested in extortion or tormenting travelers with bureaucratic burdens. Do they want a bribe? Do you need to perform a service for them? This is an archetypal abuse of power; what makes a good story?

#### The Panopticon

In the grand tower of the Panopticon, a host of immortals monitor events occurring across Eberron's planes. Countless modrons observe *crystal balls*. There are chambers in which angels and devils stand around wide scrying pools, replaying recent events. And in the highest chamber of the Panopticon, twelve solars--with one seat empty--contemplate the events occurring in the planes they are bound to and wait to be summoned by the authorities of those planes.

The Panopticon is larger than the entire city of Sharn. Different sections are devoted to each of the planes, and some immortals have spent countless years monitoring a particular location or creature. It holds the most powerful and sophisticated scrying network in existence, dwarfing the capabilities of even the dragons of Argonnessen. However, this system is not intended to benefit mortals. Adventurers must have an exceptional reason to secure a travel pass allowing admittance to the Panopticon, and the immortals who work there are not inclined to answer questions.

#### The Hall of Justice

The Hall of Justice is an immense complex containing an impossible number of courts and chambers of inquiry. In smaller chambers, immortals debate the actions of the beings observed in the Panopticon. There are angels discussing the Treaty of Thronehold, while inevitables dissect the latest actions in the endless wars of Shavarath. These debates are pro forma; while a judgment is made and recorded in the Infinite Archive, no action is ever taken. The weightier matters are resolved before an inevitable tribunal, led by a Kolyarut, an inevitable representative of the great arbiter of impartial justice whose spirit permeates the hall itself. The tribunal is typically filled out with a planetar and an amnizu, each working to sway the Kolyarut's deciding vote to their side.

Adventurers who violate the laws of Daanvi are brought before an immortal tribunal. Usually this is a straightforward matter; the judges question the accused. The accused is granted an Advocate and opposed by a Voice of Justice; typically one of these is an angel, the other a devil. Both of these immortals may conjure images from the lives of the accused, drawing on the records gathered from the Panopticon. Such a case could be resolved quickly, but depending on protocols invoked or evidence sought ("Your honors, I'd like to show you three years of the defendant's childhood"), a case can take quite a long time. Luckily for the accused, the Flowing Time property of Daanvi ensures that when--or if--they return to the Material Plane, time has passed for their friends and foes much more slowly.

Once a case is resolved, the inevitable tribunal enacts their judgment; this ruling is final, and can't be questioned or appealed. The "Daanvian Judgment" sidebar presents ideas for penalties that might be imposed on a wrongdoer.

![Artist: Vincentius Matthew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/151%20vincentius%20matthew.png)

#### The Infinite Archive

Dolurrh's Library merely contains records of every mortal soul that's passed through it. By contrast, Daanvi's Infinite Archive contains records on every being that's ever existed. Here, the data gathered by the Panopticon and the rulings of the Hall of Justice are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on each individual's deeds, whether they've adhered to or violated countless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn't generally *do* anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction to act on it. So through your life, the immortals of Daanvi have watched and judged your every action. You aren't rewarded or punished for your deeds, but they know what you've done, and it's forever preserved on your permanent record.

Mortals must present an excellent reason--or bribe a devil--to get access to the Archive, but it's not as restricted as the Panopticon. The Infinite Archive lives up to its name, and is unknowably vast. If adventurers have a legitimate inquiry, a deva sage can be quite helpful. Working with modrons is a long and tedious process, while devils make it even more unpleasant.

#### The Iron Ward

The Iron Ward, a city of gray stone, embodies the worst aspects of oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel amnizu, wields absolute power and can't be questioned or challenged. Most of the subjects of the ward are indentured servants, trapped in inescapable contracts; visitors must be careful not to accept any offers of work in the ward, lest they be similarly trapped. There are regular displays of brutal "justice" in the grand plaza. Imps scurry in the shadows, watching outsiders and carrying news of their actions to the chain devils and erinyes that serve as the brutal police force. While they can't punish adventurers "unjustly," they *can* tempt visitors into misconduct; fiendish merchants and patrons have many appealing offers for adventurers, but almost all would surely lead to breaking a law of the ward, obscure and ridiculous as it may be.

While the Iron Ward symbolizes the evils of oppressive order, it is driven by order. The police and councilors twist the law and weaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws--the one advantage adventurers have in passing through this place. And while the subjects of the Iron Ward are brutally oppressed, they're largely symbolic; it's questionable if the subjects even exist when no one's around to observe their suffering.

#### The Inescapable Prison

Maintained by devils, this oppressive layer is the embodiment of prison--the inevitable consequence of challenging the law. With the full power of Daanvi behind it, the Inescapable Prison makes Dreadhold look like a cell in the local sheriff's office. It's designed to hold celestials, elementals, and other beings with vast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen planes of existence. Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological processes are put in suspension, so they don't need to eat or drink, and they don't age. It's rare for mortals to end up here, but there may be a few legendary historical figures, long thought dead, who have instead been held in the Inescapable Prison!

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few ways Daanvi can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Daanvi--which are relatively uncommon--often share one or more of the plane's universal properties. Zones with the Plane of Truth property are often used as makeshift courtrooms by local communities, and a number of the largest courthouses in the Five Nations are built in such zones. Intelligence agencies are always searching for zones with the Eyes of the Law property. Other zones simply reflect the unnatural order of the plane--crops innately grow in perfect rows, or residents find they are more naturally inclined to follow orders. Unsubstantiated legends tell of modrons appearing in manifest zones, attempting to "repair" any local buildings and redesigning them to match the architecture of the Perfect Order.

#### Coterminous and Remote

Daanvi has coterminous and remote periods, but unlike those of other planes, these have no obvious effects. Some sages believe it may impact the performance of certain rituals or the creation of eldritch machines, and others try to link the rise of major civilizations to coterminous periods, but any supporting examples could be entirely coincidental. Daanvi is noteworthy for its exceptionally long cycle. Traditionally, when Daanvi becomes coterminous, it remains so for an entire century; one hundred years after that, it becomes remote for a century.

#### Daanvian Artifacts

Daanvi does two things remarkably well: watch people and punish them. Adventurers could come into possession of an exceptional *crystal ball* that's been stolen from the Panopticon, or a set of *dimensional shackles* lost by an orthon bounty hunter. Another way that people on the Material Plane can interact with Daanvi is through an *unbreakable contract*. In the Hall of Justice, any two creatures can negotiate a contract before a Kolyarut. The terms are inscribed on an enchanted sheet of gold (worth 5,000 gp) and bound to a marut, which acts to enforce the contract. On Eberron, a powerful conjurer could use *planar ally* or a similar spell to summon a Kolyarut to set a contract (though they must provide the gold).

### Daanvian Stories

Daanvi rarely intervenes in daily life, and people don't often think of it due to its lack of dramatic coterminous and remote cycles. Except for those who live near manifest zones, it doesn't intrude on people's lives. The main way Daanvi impacts adventures is if the party needs to get something from the plane itself--they might need knowledge contained in the Infinite Archive, or to know something that can only be seen from the Panopticon. However, they'll have to have a solid case to get past the Prime Gate... or be prepared to bribe a devil.

***The Wynarn Report.*** After an ambush gone wrong, the adventurers find themselves in possession of a file stolen from the Infinite Archive--an indestructible journal containing deep and dangerous knowledge about someone very important. A king? The patriarch of a dragonmarked house? This could be ruinous if it falls into the wrong hands, and it's possible that the Archive will send someone--or something--to recover it. Since it can't be destroyed, what will they do with it?

***The Trial.*** After an adventuring mishap on another plane--perhaps in the Immeasurable Market, as Syrania is most likely to invoke Daanvi's justice--the adventurers are collected by a solar and must account for their actions before an inevitable tribunal.

***The Convict.*** A longtime ally of the adventurers always wears a mask. During a battle, the mask is knocked aside, revealing a *judgment tattoo* that signifies LIAR. Is there a reasonable explanation for this?

***The Contract.*** The adventurers are negotiating a contract they don't intend to uphold, but the other party has a surprise; using a scroll of *planar ally*, a Kolyarut inevitable is called to establish an *unbreakable contract*. Can the adventurers find a way around this? Will they accept the contract's terms, or face the wrath of the marut and judgment in Daanvi?

## Dal Quor: The Region of Dreams

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/153%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

Dal Quor is both impossibly distant and remarkably close. Tens of thousands of years ago, the giants of Xen'drik shattered the ties between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. Since then, it's been permanently remote, and no naturally occurring manifest zone to Dal Quor has been discovered. Not even *plane shift* or astral travel can allow direct contact with the Region of Dreams. And yet, it's also the closest of the planes--to visit, just close your eyes. Dreaming is a form of spiritual travel, as your mortal consciousness is drawn to Dal Quor.

Dal Quor is the realm of dreams, a place of imagination where memory and emotion can shape reality. The stories of Thelanis bring people together in a shared tale; by contrast, the dreams of Dal Quor are unique, individual, and fleeting. They're defined by our experiences and desires, and we rarely remember them when they're over. Dreams allows us to sift through our subconscious, and they are ours alone--or at least, they *should* be... if they aren't manipulated by an outside force. The denizens of Dal Quor reflect the secondary theme of the plane, and--for now, at least--that theme is nightmares. The quori prey on mortal dreams, twisting them to produce the emotions they crave. This doesn't mean all dreams are nightmares--but when a quori takes an interest in your dream, it'll usually become one.

#### Universal Properties

Dal Quor is a place where impossible things are possible and the surroundings can change in the blink of an eye. What differentiates it from Kythri and Xoriat is that these changes are drawn from the minds of dreamers, both from the mortal subconscious and the ancient dreams of il-Lashtavar itself. Even when you're exploring someone else's dreams, your desires and memories can infect the landscape. The Shifting Dreams table provides ideas for how a dream could change.

***Extremely Morphic.*** The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the DM's discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature's dream that they're currently experiencing.

***Extended Illusion.*** When a creature casts an illusion spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

***Flowing Time.*** For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane. While sleeping for 8 hours, a creature could spend 3 days in Dal Quor.

### The Turning of the Age

The layers of Dal Quor are shaped by dreaming minds. The quori believe the heart of Dal Quor is itself the dream of an immense, ancient spirit, and that they themselves are simply part of its dream. They call this the Quor Tarai--the Dream of the Age. But there's a catch: every dream ends when the dreamer wakes up. Forty thousand years ago, the giants of Xen'drik fought a war with Dal Quor--but none of the current quori remember this war or anything that happened before it. They believe this is because the Quor Tarai came to an end. Dal Quor woke from its dream, then immediately returned to its slumber and began to dream again... but it was a *new* dream, with entirely new quori.

The quori call this transition the Turning of the Age. They don't know how many times it's happened before, and they know nothing about the quori of the previous age. But they believe that each incarnation of the Quor Tarai has its own distinct flavor. The present Quor Tarai is *il-Lashtavar*, the Great Darkness that Dreams. It's malevolent and cruel, and that's reflected by the quori it's created. But a handful of quori didn't fit in this dream. These are the quori that became the kalashtar, who consider themselves harbingers of transformation. The kalashtar believe that the next incarnation of the Quor Tarai will be an age of hope and compassion; they call it *il-Yannah,* the Great Light.

So all quori know that one day, Dal Quor will wake from its dream, and when it does, all existing quori will be destroyed. This drives the conflict between the kalashtar and the Dreaming Dark. The kalashtar believe their devotions and meditation slowly turn the wheel toward a dream of light. Meanwhile, the agents of the Dreaming Dark believe they can permanently anchor the Quor Tarai in the current age, if only they can control enough mortal dreams--a process begun with Sarlona. It's up to the DM to decide if the kalashtar can usher in a new age over the course of the campaign, or if the Dreaming Dark will maintain the status quo. If the Turning of the Age occurs, all existing quori will be destroyed and reborn; no one knows what this will do to the kalashtar or foreign creations like the Uul Dhakaan.

### Denizens

The quori, children of il-Lashtavar, are the most numerous of the native spirits of Dal Quor. But quori aren't the only creatures dreamers can encounter in the Region of Dreams.

#### Dreamers

At any given moment, there are millions of dreaming minds creating islands in Dal Quor. Humans, orcs, giants, dragons--any creature that dreams can be found in this plane.

A rare few dreamers are lucid and in full control of their actions, due to either training or magic; these are capable of leaving their own dreams and moving between the plane's dream islands and layers. However, the vast majority of dreamers aren't lucid. They're driven by their subconscious, and react based on instinct and deep desires; they likely won't remember the events of a dream clearly. Either way, when a dreamer dies in their dream, they wake up; however, this death can still have consequences, as *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* describes in "The Dreaming Dark" section of chapter 4.

#### Figments and Drifters

When you have a dream and you meet your old drill sergeant, it's not actually your old drill sergeant, and it's (probably) not a quori. It's simply a figment, manifested from the void by Dal Quor. When you wake up--or even just leave the scene--this manifestation vanishes, absorbed back into the essence of the plane. A figment can be anything--a friend of yours, a zombie version of that friend, a demon, a dragon--but the catch is that it's drawn from the mind of the local dreamer. When you dream about your old drill sergeant, they can't tell you a secret you don't already know, because they're part of you. On the other hand, if you're in someone else's dream--or if a quori has taken control of your dream--then the figments can surprise you, because their capabilities and knowledge are drawn from someone else's mind.

A figment could use the statistics of the creature it represents, or it might be limited, as the dreamer doesn't know what it's actually capable of. Conversely, a figment goblin could have the statistics of an ogre--in this dream, that's one tough goblin.

Occasionally, a remarkable figment develops the ability to persist beyond the dream that created it--becoming a truly sentient spirit instead of a simple manifestation. Such figments might be useful guides or allies for mortal dreamers, or become predators that travel from dream to dream and prey on mortal fears. Such free-willed figments are called drifters.

#### The Quori

The quori themselves are figments--figments of il-Lashtavar, the current Dream of the Age. However, these figments are immortal, and don't disappear when a mortal's dream ends; if they're destroyed, they're simply reborn within the heart of il-Lashtavar. Like other figments, they come into existence knowing the role they are supposed to play: they are shapers of nightmares. Each type of quori feeds on a particular emotion; tsucora quori craft terrifying nightmares so they can feast on mortal fear, while the du'ulora thrive on anger.

When a quori enters a dream, it can create new figments, alter the story's script, or change its own appearance (though its statistics remain the same). If the invading quori is killed within the dream, the story reverts to the original script, so most quori prefer to remain in the background while shaping a dream; however, some are arrogant and can't resist playing a starring role. The quori don't create every nightmare; there are millions of dreamers, while the quori number only in the thousands. But the nightmares they personally create are works of art.

In the first days of il-Lashtavar, the quori had no purpose aside from preying on mortal dreams. Now they believe they're fighting for their survival, and they use their abilities to manipulate mortals and the waking world. But always remember that the quori began as crafters of nightmares, and consider how each quori's favorite emotion may color its actions.

#### Interlopers

Some creatures in Dal Quor are neither figments nor mortal dreamers. Night hags freely come and go, collecting nightmares for their own purposes. Here are some other interlopers.

***The Fey of the Fading Dream.*** Taer Lian Doresh is a feyspire, one of the eladrin cities of Thelanis. Long ago, the tyrant empyrean Cul'sir cursed the feyspire and cast it into Dal Quor. Caught in the transformation of the Quor Tarai, these eladrin became embodiments of classic nightmares, and ease their pain by spreading fear among mortals. (They can be represented using shadar-kai stat blocks, but aren't shadar-kai and have no ties to Dolurrh's Queen of the Dead.)

Taer Lian Doresh now exists between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. The eladrin of this feyspire can freely pass to both planes, but other creatures can only enter Taer Lian Doresh and return to their plane of origin; they can't use it as a portal to the other plane. Thus, quori and adventurers can walk the halls of the Fading Dream together, but the quori can't cross over to physically enter Eberron itself, nor can the denizens of the Material Plane (including eladrin of other feyspires, humans, and all other creatures of Eberron) enter Dal Quor.

***The Draconic Eidolon.*** Many dragons of Argonnessen believe they can attain immortality after death, passing through Dolurrh and becoming divine beings. However, some aren't willing to take that chance; using an eldritch machine hidden deep in Argonnessen, the most powerful can perform a ritual that tethers their spirits to a psychic anchor in Dal Quor. This Draconic Eidolon, a monument in the Ocean of Dreams, holds the souls of dragons long dead instead of releasing them to Dolurrh. The dragons no longer exist physically; like the Undying Court, they're a union of spirits, possessing greater power together than they would individually. They can't leave the Eidolon, but possess vast knowledge--secrets of history, insight into the Prophecy, and knowledge of epic magic. They have much to offer, but what do adventurers have that the dreams of dead dragons might want?

#### Layers

Dal Quor doesn't have layers like other planes. Instead, it can be seen as a vast ocean. When a mortal dreams, they fall into that ocean and create an "island": a dream pocket, shaped by their memories and desires. When they wake, this island disappears. So at any given moment, Dal Quor contains millions of islands, but none last for long. A passive dreamer can't leave their own island, but a lucid dreamer can find ways to travel between them. Typically this involves portals, doors within a dream that have a psychic connection to the destination--but it's also possible to break through the psychic border of an island, to fly to another island on a ship of dreams or an imaginary winged beast.

These flickering islands orbit the stable core of the realm, the dark heart of the Quor Tarai. In addition to the regions discussed below, there may be other permanent islands in the Ocean of Dreams, following the example of the Uul Dhakaan and the Draconic Eidolon. Who created the island, and what sustains it?

***The Ocean of Dreams.*** A vast expanse of psychic space surrounds il-Lashtavar, home to millions of mortal dreams. The islands in the Ocean of Dreams range from the complex dreamscapes of sentient creatures, humans and dragons alike, to the simple dream of a dog that's imagining chasing a ball. From the outside, these islands appear as glittering bubbles, each with an image of its dreamer within it. They're loosely arranged based on the physical location of the dreamer, so there's a stretch of the ocean that contains dreamers near Breland, another for Thrane, and so on--including regions for any dreamers currently on other planes.

***The Riedran Sea.*** Over centuries, the Inspired have built a network of monoliths in Riedra, psychic anchors called *hanbalani altas*. These allow them to control everyone's dreams over a vast radius. Dreams are typically tailored to the region, including local news and instructions. However, if they choose, the Inspired can broadcast a single dream to all of Sarlona. Within Dal Quor, this manifests as a distinctive region of the Ocean of Dreams--an array of hundreds of thousands of islands, dream-bubbles arranged in perfect symmetrical rows, with identical images in each bubble.

***The Uul Dhakaan.*** Jhazaal Dhakaan united the dar through an act of epic bardic magic. When the dar dream, they don't create their own islands in the Ocean. Instead, they are drawn to a vast, ongoing dream--the Uul Dhakaan, as discussed in chapter 4. This is a vision of what the Dhakaani Empire could and should be, and it encompasses many cities and fortresses. In addition to the spirits of dreaming dar, this enormous dream is filled with countless figments--both background soldiers, artisans, and facsimiles of legendary champions whose memories have been preserved. Most dar aren't lucid dreamers and they don't fully remember the time they spend in the Uul Dhakaan, but it reinforces Dhakaani values and traditions. If adventurers want to experience what the Dhakaani Empire was at its height--and what it could be again--they can find it here. Chot'uul guardians maintain outposts throughout the dream, along with a great monastery in the capital city. The magic woven into the dream ensures that the throne in the imperial palace remains empty--for now. But when a new emperor is chosen and has the support of the majority of the dar, they'll hold the throne in the Uul Dhakaan as well as in the Material Plane.

***Il-Lashtavar.*** The dark heart of Dal Quor, il-Lashtavar, is the current incarnation of the Quor Tarai. This vast dreamscape, orbited by the Ocean of Dreams, is the source and home of the quori. It's a menagerie of nightmares, a showcase of terrors that haunt the dreams of mortals. On the edges of il-Lashtavar, corpses dangle from the trees of a haunted orchard. Blood drips from the leaves of a terrifying topiary maze. While the basic form of these nightmares is stable, they feed on the psyches of nearby mortals. Adventurers walking through the orchard see the hanging corpses as the people they most care about, or even as themselves--whatever is most disturbing to each intruder.

Those who press through this outer ring of nightmares find the great fortress-city of the Devourer of Dreams, the kalaraq quori who coordinates the actions of the Dreaming Dark on Eberron. The quori spirits tied to agents of the Dreaming Dark and the Inspired can return here whenever they choose, reporting to the Devourer and coordinating with other quori. The flowing time works to their advantage, as an hour in Dal Quor is just a few minutes on Eberron. The fortress itself is ever shifting; it might be formed from black twisted roots, or the walls could be blood-soaked spiderwebs. At the very center is a pool of shadows. It's here that newborn quori emerge when they're reincarnated, and here that the Devourer of Dreams descends into the pool to commune with the Great Darkness.

Il-Lashtavar is the most dangerous place in Dal Quor. At any given time, there are hundreds or even thousands of quori here. The Great Darkness doesn't act directly, but its presence can be felt in how the environment shifts to showcase the nightmares of intruders. Dreamers who die in this place can be trapped the same way kalaraq bind the souls of their victims. Only the most powerful and prepared adventurers should enter il-Lashtavar.

In those regions of il-Lashtavar that appear to be outdoors, adventurers may notice a dark, nearly invisible moon in the sky. A sage with considerable skill in History or Arcana may recognize this as the moon Crya, thought to be destroyed in the Age of Giants. Perhaps it was thrown into Dal Quor and could somehow be returned, restoring the plane to its proper orbit--or perhaps this is only il-Lashtavar dreaming of the lost moon.

#### Planar Manifestations

Ever since the Age of Giants, it's been nearly impossible to physically interact with Dal Quor from the Material Plane. This forces the quori tied to the kalashtar and the Inspired to act through mortal agents. The only denizens of Dal Quor that can easily enter the world are the fey of the Fading Dream. The plane is always remote; undoing this damage would be an epic quest, potentially returning the thirteenth moon to the sky. But even at a distance, Dal Quor can affect the waking world.

***Dreams.*** The primary way that Dal Quor manifests in the world is through dreams. Chapter 4 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* discusses the roles that dreams can play in a campaign.

***Manifest Zones.*** The metaphysical damage caused in the conflict between Dal Quor and the giants of Xen'drik broke the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor. There are no naturally occurring manifest zones to Dal Quor, and even *plane shift* won't allow travel there. However, though *natural* manifest zones don't exist, anything is possible with an eldritch machine, whether in the hands of the Dreaming Dark pursuing subtle conquest, or simply an eccentric artificer seeking the advancement of arcane science.

***Quori Artifacts.*** While it's rare to encounter objects on Eberron that come from Dal Quor, the Inspired of Sarlona create objects using quori techniques. The primary substance used in quori objects is a form of solidified emotion called *sentira*. It has an opalescent, organic texture similar to polished horn; the color depends on the emotion used in its creation, and the wearer can feel that emotion as a constant background presence in their mind. As a material, sentira is light and extremely strong, similar to mithral; an agent of the Dreaming Dark might wear armor that's functionally *mithral armor* but actually made from sentira. Quori items generally enhance telepathy or other psychic effects; a *ring of mind shielding* or *crystal ball of mind reading* would be logical creations of the quori.

#### Quori Stories

Chapter 4 of Eberron: Rising from the Last War provides story ideas related to dreams and the Dreaming Dark. Adventures can also use the kra'uul and uul'kur from chapter 7 of this book.

***Familiar Figments, Figment Familiars.*** The adventurers discover their dreams all share the same figure, appearing regularly to each of them. It could be humanoid (a childhood friend, an old mentor), a shapechanging raven, or a talking purple cat. It was once merely a figment of one of their dreams, but it's become a drifter, able to move between dreams. It could offer advice, carry messages to characters when they're separated from friends, or warn of things it's seen in the dreams of their enemies.

***The Treacherous Whisper.*** A single fortress in the Uul Dhakaan has become infected by a daelkyr curse, turning the figments within it into aberrations. Can this be contained and cleansed before it spreads and destroys the dream itself?

***The Fortress of the Fading Dream.*** Taer Lian Doresh exists on the edge of Dal Quor, where mortals and quori meet face to face. The tsucora Astaleth has recently turned to the Path of Light and is hiding within the fortress; if she leaves, she'll be consumed by il-Lashtavar. Can adventurers find a way to save the rebel quori? Why is the leader Shan Lian Doresh allowing her to shelter in his hall?

## Dolurrh: The Realm of the Dead

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/156%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

Endless caverns stretch throughout Dolurrh, bleak passages of gray stone. Wherever you go, shadowy figures reach toward you, imploring, but you feel only the faintest chill as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Mist pools around your feet, and as you press forward, you realize this swirling mist is moaning. This is no natural phenomenon; these are the remnants of souls who have forgotten themselves. This is Dolurrh. It's not the embodiment of the idea of death or dying, both of which are reflected in Mabar. Rather, Dolurrh is where mortal souls go after their bodies die, where memories fade and lives are forgotten.

Mortal spirits are drawn to Dolurrh within moments of death, and their memories begin to decay immediately. Within days, most spirits no longer have any desire to leave Dolurrh, and within weeks, most only have the faintest memories of their previous lives. The faiths of Aerenal and the Blood of Vol assert that Dolurrh is the absolute end of existence, the last echoes of a life before it's completely gone. But when Dorius Alyre ir'Korran drew his classic planar map (seen at the beginning of this book), he used the Octogram symbol of the Sovereign Host to represent Dolurrh, because he declared it to be the door through which all mortals must pass to join with the Sovereigns. This has come to be a common view: what appears to be memory fading is actually the soul slowly ascending to a higher form of existence, rising to a level of reality no mortal can experience. The Vassals of the Sovereign Host say the faithful finally join the Sovereigns; followers of the Silver Flame say that noble souls strengthen the Flame. What is left is only a husk--the cast-off remnants, like an abandoned snakeskin or the traces of memory that can be read using *speak with dead*. Thus, while Dolurrh has long been known as the Realm of the Dead, many call it the Gateway. Ultimately, this is a matter of faith--whether the other side of Dolurrh is oblivion or paradise, no one ever returns from it.

The sage Annolysse of Arcanix declared that Dolurrh must be the thirteenth plane, for it has no opposite. It doesn't embody an idea so much as it serves a purpose--that of gathering, collecting, and (perhaps) transitioning souls. Mortal actions are judged in Daanvi; by contrast, Dolurrh doesn't judge and it doesn't punish. It's simply the end of the journey--or depending how you look at it, the beginning of a new one.

All living creatures come to Dolurrh, sooner or later. Those that come here before death are almost always looking for something--a lost soul, a forgotten memory. But living or dead, any who come to Dolurrh can be trapped by its power.

#### Universal Properties

Everything about Dolurrh is gray and gloomy. Even the brightest colors seem faded, the most joyful sounds seem dull. The heavy weight of ennui settles on travelers the moment they arrive, making even the simplest tasks feel challenging. And there's a constant pull, tugging on memory and emotion, a desire to just sit down and let it all go.

***Eternal Ennui.*** When a creature enters Dolurrh, it immediately gains one level of ennui (described in the "Ennui" sidebar). While in Dolurrh, this level of ennui can't be removed by rest or by any other means. It's immediately removed when the creature leaves Dolurrh. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property's effects.

***Impeded Magic.*** In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

***Inevitable Entrapment.*** Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it gains one level of ennui. Each time it makes this saving throw, the DC increases by 1. Whenever a creature ends a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, it must make this saving throw as if it had just finished a rest, but its roll is made with disadvantage. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property's effects.

***Timeless.*** Time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. Creatures can benefit from resting, suffer damage, and die. However, a creature on Dolurrh doesn't age, and doesn't need to eat, sleep, or drink.

> ##### Ennui
>
>Ennui drains motion and memory, reflecting the soul-sapping power of Dolurrh. This special condition is measured in levels, and has the same effects and rules as exhaustion (as presented in appendix A of the *Player's Handbook*), with one exception--ennui affects all creatures that aren't native to Dolurrh, including undead and other creatures immune to exhaustion. Ennui is separate from exhaustion, and exhaustion levels don't stack with ennui. If a creature has both ennui and exhaustion, use whichever condition it has more levels of to determine the effects.
>
>Undead can't recover from ennui while in Dolurrh. Whenever a living creature with 2 or more levels of ennui finishes a long rest, if it succeeds against its saving throw against Dolurrh's Inevitable Entrapment property by 5 or more, it reduces its ennui level by 1. When a creature leaves Dolurrh, all levels of ennui are removed.
>
>When a creature reaches 6 levels of ennui, its will is completely broken and it can take no purposeful action; if this happens to a living creature, its physical body dies and it becomes a husk bound to Dolurrh.
>

### Denizens

In many ways, Dolurrh is a machine. The pull that draws spirits to Dolurrh is a mechanical effect, part of the fundamental nature of souls. The denizens of Dolurrh are the cogs of that machine, here to keep the system running.

#### The Quick

The native creatures of Dolurrh are bound to the cycle of transition, and all have some role to serve in this process. All of the Quick are immune to the ennui condition.

**Nalfeshnee** demons patrol the Catacombs of Dolurrh, dispersing melds and lemures and dealing with mortal intruders. They appear as large humanoids whose features are shrouded in gray mist, and they delight in crushing mortals and pulling the shades from their corpses, as well as consuming lemures.

**MTF** inevitables are powerful guardians, crafted in the Crucible of Dolurrh, forged from husksteel, and tasked to preserve the cycle of life and death. Maruts are occasionally dispatched to Eberron to intervene with acts of resurrection, or when a lich or mummy is created. No one's sure what triggers this deadly intervention--perhaps the resurrection defied the Prophecy--but Jorasco healers always cast augury before raising the dead. If the result is "woe," they refuse the job, lest a Dolurrhi marut appear, destroying the resurrected creature, its healer, and possibly the whole healing house in the process.

Shadar-kai are servants of the Queen of the Dead, shades granted new life. Though their new forms appear elf-like, they might've been any sort of humanoid in their previous life; when they caught the Queen's attention, she preserved their soul from entrapment. The shadar-kai serve in the Vault of Memories, and occasionally as her hands on Eberron. They might clash with necromancers (especially the agents of Lady Illmarrow), collect trinkets, or target mortals with no rhyme or reason. Many sages attempt to explain these enigmatic actions, often speculating that they're collecting especially tragic memories for the Vault.

Other denizens of Dolurrh are unique, such as the Librarian, found in the Vault of Memories, and the Smith of Souls, who dwells in the Crucible.

#### The Dead

The spirits of those who have died are omnipresent in Dolurrh, from shades huddled in the shadows to layers of moaning mist. The Dead might be considered manifestations of Dolurrh, but the plane didn't actually create them--all were once mortals. Shades are mortal souls that are freshly arrived in Dolurrh. They maintain a portion of their memory and original appearance, though they're insubstantial and can't interact with material objects.

**Shades** are susceptible to ennui, and as they gain levels, their appearance blurs and their memories slowly fade. Shades can speak, and they may cry or beg adventurers to help them; however, most are incapable of taking any actions on their own. They're often found lost in thought, trying to remember something they've forgotten, or fixating on a past mistake.

**Husks** are harmless shades that have been overcome by ennui and possess only the vaguest memories of their mortal existence. Most retain a semblance of their mortal shape, but they continue to fade over decades, eventually merging with other husks to form masses of moaning mist. Having no true consciousness of their own, husks are immune to ennui's effects. Occasionally, a group of husks cluster around a strong memory, forming an ectoplasmic mass that prowls in search of more scraps of memory, absorbing other husks. Such a creature is called a meld, and its statistics are provided in chapter 8.

**Ghosts** are formed when a shade clings to a particular memory with such intensity that even Dolurrh can't completely eradicate it--perhaps a terrible mistake or a bitter grudge. The rest of the spirit's memories fade, and it becomes immune to ennui, but this ember remains, defining its existence. Ghosts are driven by a primal desire to return to Eberron, to haunt the place where they died or where their anchoring memory was forged; they might escape to the Material Plane when Dolurrh is coterminous or when a resurrection goes wrong. Ghosts that are destroyed eventually reform; they can only find peace if their unfinished business is resolved.

Other forms of undead are rarely seen in Dolurrh. The entities found in this plane are the spirits of the dead, slowly fading, transitioning--or trapped in that process. Corporeal undead such as ghouls, skeletons, and zombies have no place here, while undead that hunger to consume life belong in Mabar.

#### The Lingering

Memories of joy and happiness do no harm in Dolurrh. But memories of pain, of cruelty, of anger... these don't fade so easily, and they can hurt others. Even if they don't trap shades as ghosts, this psychic residue can build up in the gears of the spiritual machinery of Dolurrh. It often takes the presence of a mortal to trigger it; when this occurs, the lingering pain and hate coalesces into a solid form. The least of these are lemures, formed from hateful memories or deeds. The emotional residue of hundreds or thousands of people can form deadly sorrowsworn--the Angry, the Hungry, the Lonely, the Lost, and the Wretched--as presented in *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*. The Lingering are formed in Dolurrh and are immune to ennui, but they're a waste product, not the plane's desired result. As such, nalfeshnee, maruts, and other guardians destroy the Lingering whenever they are found.

#### The Queen of the Dead

The Queen of the Dead, the most powerful being in Dolurrh, dwells in the great spire that rises up above the Vault of Memories. Little is known about her motives or her origins; curiously, she focuses on the Material Plane far more than most great planar powers do. Though she existed long before the elves, the Queen appears as an elf woman, her face hidden by a cracked alabaster mask, her robes of black feathers trimmed with silver. She can pluck shades from the cycle of entrapment, and even grant them new life, creating shadar-kai by housing them in new bodies. Other souls, she saves but doesn't restore, preserving them in the Vault of Memories. She collects secrets and memories, plucking her favorites from those gathered by the Librarian and keeping them in her personal collection. Sometimes she directly opposes mortal necromancers, especially Lady Illmarrow. At other times, she seems interested in killing specific people, perhaps so she can preserve their spirits or their memories. But such direct action is extremely rare, remarkable if it occurs more than once in a century; most of the time, she remains silent in Dolurrh, unknown and unknowable.

Rarely, the bravest (and most foolish) of adventurers venture into the Queen of the Dead's realm, hoping to reclaim a lost spirit from Dolurrh. And rarely, they succeed, for she doesn't care if a shade or two are stolen every century, or even every decade. However, in the Age of Giants, the Cul'sir Dominion sent an army into Dolurrh to recover the spirits of a family lost in the Quori Conflict--none of them returned. The Queen's power cannot be contested in Dolurrh, and thieves who attract her personal attention find their shades torn from their bodies in the blink of an eye.

### Layers

Dolurrh is universally gray and gloomy. The accounts of brave explorers describe the sense of being underground, and no mortal has seen the moon or sky of Dolurrh. Unlike most planes, the layers of Dolurrh don't embody different ideas; instead, they serve different functions in this grand machine dedicated to processing souls.

The four layers discussed below are the only ones described in the records of mortals who ventured to Dolurrh--and returned. But there could be more, as yet undiscovered, each likely serving a critical purpose. It's known that the Librarian has recorded the lives of dragons in the Vault of Memories; accordingly, sages theorize there may be a layer dedicated entirely to the spirits of dragonkind, which may linger longer than the spirits of simple humanoids.

#### The Catacombs

Endless tunnels of gray stone wind through the Catacombs, the destination of humanoid spirits. Some passages are painfully tight, while others widen into grand halls with ceilings lost in darkness. The Dead are everywhere, shades pleading for release, husks keening in the shadows. The chambers of the Catacombs might contain vast wells filled with moaning mist, or nalfeshnees herding shades into pens and scraping lemures off the walls. The Catacombs may be larger than Khorvaire, or even Eberron itself. A mortal could wander forever through these winding tunnels--at least until they're consumed by ennui. However, there are junction points that transcend the logic of distance. If one knows the right symbols to follow, they can cross the vastness of the Catacombs quickly or pass to other layers--perhaps in search of a shade to rescue, as discussed in the "Concerning Resurrection" section.

#### The Kennel

The Kennel is similar in appearance to the Catacombs, but contains the shades and husks of beasts and monstrosities, along with the nalfeshnee and maruts that tend them. Here, you'll hear the howls of fading wolf spirits, and see flocks of spectral birds flying through grand halls, along with larger and fiercer creatures. Beast spirits rarely linger long in Dolurrh, as most have fewer memories to erase. But all dogs go to Dolurrh!

The Queen of the Dead might have created special servants that wander these halls, just as she made the shadar-kai. It's possible adventurers could be questioned by a clever raven with the soul of a poet.

#### The Crucible

In this grand foundry, tended by shadar-kai and guarded by newly forged maruts, the immortal spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits into husksteel. From these lingering scraps of memory and emotion, she forges the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai, and creates the maruts from the husks of brave souls. She also creates smaller and stranger items from husksteel, as described in the "Dolurrhi Artifacts" section.

The Smith wears a mask of black steel and an apron of dragonhide. When forging maruts, she takes the form of a giant, and when crafting tiny trinkets, a gnome. It's possible that she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can replicate their works at her forge.

#### The Vault of Memories

The heart of Dolurrh is the Vault of Memories. This tower, carved up through gray stone, is larger than any of the great towers of Sharn. The lowest levels hold the Vault's library; here, the spirit known as the Librarian interviews each shade and makes a record of its life. His power is such that an entire life can be confined to a single large page. Every sigil inscribed holds a crucial memory, and if a creature is proficient in Arcana, they can read the symbol to experience that memory. The many floors of the library hold countless books of preserved lives, carefully tended by shadar-kai scribes. The Librarian himself is a massive hooded figure--his books are likewise enormous. It's said that he can be many places at once, allowing him to speak to every shade, capturing the story of its life, before it fades.

In the halls above the library, the Queen of the Dead keeps her many treasures. What seem to be obsidian statues are actually shades, crystallized to prevent them from being entrapped and lost in Dolurrh. Paintings and crystals contain memories that the Queen has chosen to isolate. Beyond these are countless trinkets and oddities, items collected by her shadar-kai over the vast scope of history. And higher still are the chambers of the Queen herself, where she usually sits in silent contemplation, listening to the whispers of the countless shades in her domain.

### Concerning Resurrection

Returning life to the dead isn't a reliable service in Eberron. Many characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, from clerics to adepts of House Jorasco. But just because a spell *can* be cast doesn't mean that it *should* be cast... or that it will work if it does. The first and simplest limitation is time. The longer a spirit remains in Dolurrh, the more it falls under the sway of ennui. Any spell that returns life to the dead requires the spirit to *want* to return. Once the shade becomes a husk, it can no longer make that decision, and thus can't be raised or reincarnated. Most religions maintain that this happens because the true soul has moved on to a higher level of existence; who wants to be pulled back from a union with the Sovereigns? So you only have about a week or two--depending on the strength of the target's will--to pull them back. But even before that time, a spirit might choose not to return. What do they have to live for? Is it worth fighting the lulling ennui of Dolurrh?

The second limitation is risk. Even if a spell is successful, Jorasco remains rightly concerned about whether that person is *supposed* to come back, or if it's their time to die--for if it's the latter, a marut may appear to challenge any resurrection. This is extraordinarily rare, but in part, that's because healers perform an *augury* ritual beforehand and refuse to raise someone if there's a risk. Even if a marut doesn't intervene, there's a risk the resurrection could go poorly if Dolurrh is coterminous, perhaps calling back other spirits in addition to--or instead of--the person being brought back to life.

The final limitation is the direct intervention of a higher power. The Queen of the Dead might crystallize a shade and prevent it from being restored, or catch a spirit that's about to be restored and set a price on its passage; a few examples are given on the Cost of a Life table. How long does the beneficiary have to settle their account? A day, a year, a lifetime? It's also said that the Keeper can snatch souls before they even reach Dolurrh; if this myth is true, such souls can only be recovered from the Lair of the Keeper in the Demon Wastes. The Keeper itself may or may not be there, but it's certainly the abode of a powerful dracolich!

The flip side of direct intervention is that the Queen of the Dead (or another powerful entity) might offer to return a shade to life--for a price. This is a way to bring a low-level character back to life, despite their friends being unable to afford resurrection. The Cost of a Life table provides ideas.

If all else fails, there's one way you can always bring someone to life: go to Dolurrh, find their shade, and drag it back out to the Material Plane. It's simple--all you need to do is to locate a single soul in the endless Catacombs (perhaps with the help of a native guide, records in the Vault of Memories, or powerful divination magic), evade Dolurrh's many guardians, and return to Eberron with the soul in tow. If you succeed, the victim receives a new body, just as if you'd cast *true resurrection*; and while Dolurrh's defenders will try to stop you from leaving, they won't interfere once you return to Eberron. It's theoretically possible to restore a husk in this way as well, though the resurrected husk generally won't regain its lost memories, even though it might learn new skills. As a result, it wouldn't do any good to bring back the Tairnadal ancestors or Galifar I; you could bring a *body* back to life, but it's not the original person in any meaningful way. This is why the Queen of the Dead (and perhaps the Keeper) preserves certain shades from decay--so that they might one day be restored, even after thousands of years.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are some ways Dolurrh can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Dolurrh rarely possess all of the plane's properties; travelers generally aren't entrapped by ennui simply by passing through one. But these zones are still close to the Realm of the Dead and exceptionally haunted, though not blighted, as Mabaran zones typically are. Shadows move in disturbing ways, and travelers may hear whispers they can't quite make out.

The restless spirits of Dolurrh yearn to return to the Material Plane, and it's easier for them to do so in manifest zones. They might manifest as ghosts, or animate the corpses of people buried in the zone, causing them to return as revenants or zombies. In some Dolurrhi zones, raising the dead can be dangerous; if spells or abilities that raise the dead are used in such a zone, roll on the Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps table to determine the result.

Dolurrhi zones can also have positive effects. In many zones, it's easier to return people from the dead, halving the cost of any material components. In others, anyone can cast *speak with dead* as a ritual that takes an hour to perform, as long as they have a personal connection to the deceased whose corpse they're questioning.

The most dramatic manifest zones are those that serve as gateways to enter the Catacombs of Dolurrh--and hopefully, to return. Opening such a gateway might call for a special ritual or significant sacrifice, perhaps under a particular alignment of the moon Aryth, or when Dolurrh is conterminous.

#### Coterminous and Remote

Dolurrh has a slow planar cycle. Traditionally, once a century, it becomes coterminous for a full year. Fifty years after that, it's remote for a full year. It can also have shorter phases, tied to the movements of the moon Aryth.

While Dolurrh is coterminous, it's easier for ghosts to slip from the Realm of the Dead into the Material Plane, especially around Dolurrhi manifest zones. Any spell or ability that raises the dead can also serve as a conduit for unwanted spirits; roll on the Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps table when any such spell is cast.

While Dolurrh is remote, traditional resurrection magic, such as *revivify* or *reincarnate*, can't pull spirits back from Dolurrh. The only way to raise the dead in these times is by traveling to Dolurrh itself and pulling the shade back to the world, as described earlier in this section. Surprisingly, ghosts are also especially common in this time--but these aren't ghosts that return from Dolurrh. Rather, if Dolurrh is remote when someone dies in the grip of great emotion or with vital unfinished business, their spirit can more easily resist Dolurrh's pull, remaining on the Material Plane.

#### Dolurrhi Artifacts

The most common Dolurrhi artifacts are creations of the Smith of Shadows, formed of husksteel, the fused essence of faded souls. Despite the name, husksteel can appear not only as dark metal, but also as slick black leather, dark iridescent cloth, or other substances. Such an object could be crafted from a single spirit--a dagger whose edge is forged from a single moment of pain--or from the emotional residue of multiple husks.

In creating a husksteel object, consider the memory or emotion that's the heart of the item. For a magic item, this should reflect its purpose. A husksteel *cloak of elvenkind* could be formed from a secret. A husksteel variation on a *dagger of venom* might be formed from a moment of absolute terror; when its power is invoked, it could deal psychic damage and, on a failed Wisdom save, make the target frightened of the wielder.

Other Dolurrhi items are largely curiosities. The Dolurrhi Trinkets table provides examples.

### Dolurrhi Stories

Dolurrh can inspire many simple stories through its manifest zones and escaped ghosts. A husksteel trinket could provide a flash of memory that sets the adventurers on a particular path, and finding a way to rescue a shade from the underworld is always an epic tale. Here are a few deeper stories to consider.

***The Once and Future Queen of the Dead.*** The Queen of the Dead is an enigmatic figure who wields great power in Dolurrh. But there's another being who uses this title: Erandis Vol, the last heir of the Mark of Death. Through her agents in the Order of the Emerald Claw and beyond, Erandis seeks to restore the power of her dragonmark; no one knows what godlike powers she might wield if she unlocks its full potential. Meanwhile, Dolurrh's Queen of the Dead seems to oppose Erandis, and often sends her agents--both shadar-kai and adventurers she's restored to life at a price--to interfere with Vol's schemes. This could be exactly what it appears; the Queen of the Dead may despise necromancers, and Vol is seeking to depose her. But perhaps there's more to it. Time works in strange ways when dealing with the planes and beings of vast power. Perhaps the Queen of the Dead isn't trying to stop Erandis, but guiding her down a very specific path. Perhaps Erandis will *become* the Queen of the Dead, in which case, she'll have always been her. Or perhaps that's what's *supposed* to happen, but there's a way in which it could still go wrong... which could destroy the Queen of the Dead and throw Dolurrh itself into chaos.

***Agent of Death.*** The adventurers kill a nefarious villain that's long eluded them--but soon, their foe reappears alive and well. This happens time and again. How is the villain escaping from Dolurrh? Are they acting as an agent for the Queen of the Dead, or have they simply found a back door to the Realm of the Dead? Either way, what can the adventurers do to lay them to rest once and for all?

***Devastating Sorrow.*** When Dolurrh becomes coterminous, a powerful sorrowsworn emerges and devastates the region. The adventurers may not have the ability to defeat the sorrowsworn in battle, but if they understand the circumstances of its creation--the emotion that drives it and the event that triggered it--they might be able to disperse the deadly monster by defusing this emotion. When an adventurer touches--or is touched by--one of Dolurrh's Dead or Lingering, they might sense a flash of any lingering memory or emotion that creature possesses. Can this help them solve the mystery, or will they die in the attempt?

***The Warforged Soul.*** There are many who believe that warforged are simply tools; House Cannith may be able to infuse something with life, but it can't create a soul. Others say that it's not a question of science; the warforged are clearly alive, and thus, they have souls. But is the soul unique? Or could it be that warforged *recycle* souls, drawing husks drained of memory from Dolurrh and using them as a foundation? These questions are intentionally left unanswered; it's up to each DM to determine the true nature of warforged souls. But there's one simple fact: a warforged can be restored to life with *revivify* or *raise dead*. Which means that the answer must lie in Dolurrh, and someone--Arcanix? Merrix d'Cannith? The Lord of Blades?--could fund an expedition to find the answer.

## Fernia: The Sea of Flame

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/161%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

A massive shard of basalt rises out of a vast ocean of magma. A castle sprawls atop the peak, a glittered fortress sculpted from brass. Firefalls of lava tumble down the edge of the spire. A flight of red dragons takes to the air, circling the castle and creating a dazzling spectacle of synchronized flames. Welcome to High Hearth: the party's about to begin.

It's simple to say that Fernia embodies the concept of fire. The plane is filled with magma and flame, from massive volcanoes to cities eternally on the verge of being consumed by fire. But Fernia isn't about mundane fire; Lamannia is the source of simple, natural flame, and holds volcanoes and fire elementals. Rather, Fernia is about all the things we see in the flame, all the ideas it represents. It has layers reflecting wild destruction, where verdant forests eternally burn. It incorporates industry, with legions of azers forever toiling over fire and forge. And it reflects wild passion, burning emotions that can't be held in, and glorious spectacle; these are the realm of the efreet, the lords of the Sea of Flame, forever striving to outshine their rivals.

Fire draws the eye and the attention, but where there's magma, there's also earth. The azers stand between earth and flame, harvesting the ore they feed to their hungry forges. And in the deep caverns, the dao polish jewels and admire their treasures. Even in these deep layers, the air sears the lungs of creatures that lack the proper protection, but for adventurers willing to brave the flames, wonders and wealth are waiting in the halls of fire and stone.

#### Universal Properties

The sweltering heat of Fernia can be deadly to unprotected creatures, and it burns through mortal metabolisms. The following properties apply to the entire plane.

***Deadly Heat.*** All regions of Fernia are subject to extreme heat (as defined in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). In some areas of particularly deadly heat, a creature without protection must make a Constitution saving throw every minute instead of every hour. In addition, all creatures gain resistance to cold damage, and a creature that is usually resistant to cold damage becomes immune to it.

***Empowered Fire.*** When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals fire damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

***Fires of Industry.*** A creature has advantage on ability checks using tools (such as baking with *cook's utensils*, or forging an item with *smith's tools*) when it incorporates Fernian flame into its action in place of mundane flame.

***Burning Bright.*** Whenever a creature makes a death saving throw, it must make an additional saving throw, keeping the results of both rolls. In addition, when a creature gains a level of exhaustion, it gains an extra level; when it reduces a level of exhaustion, it reduces it by an additional level. In Fernia, whether you live or die, it's going to happen quickly!

***Standard Time.*** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

### Denizens

Fernia is home to celestials and fiends, spirits that embody key concepts of fire and flame. But its primary denizens are elementals of earth and fire. There are no native mortals or manifestations in Fernia: the elemental population is set in stone, and when one elemental dies, a new one takes its place. This can take many forms; new mephits spring out of open flame, while the dao craft new azers out of bronze. But overall, the population is stable; when an efreeti pits two legions of salamanders against one another in a grand display, they know the salamanders will eventually be reborn.

#### Efreet

The **efreet** are the brightest stars in the firmament of Fernia. They are aristocrats, dwelling in sprawling mansions and castles, attended by countless servants, dwelling amidst astonishing opulence. Fire consumes, and the efreet are masters of conspicuous consumption. They are passionate and wild, quick to both anger and joy. They are casually cruel, and can consume or destroy the lives of others even as they celebrate. However, the efreet aren't conquerors, for they already have everything they could possibly want; their elemental servants exist to serve them, and the efreet consider them to be casually disposable.

The efreet have been competing with one another since the dawn of time. Passionate arguments can escalate into dramatic duels, and now and again, two efreet unleash their armies in a grand display of fire and burning blood. But by and large, the conflict between the efreet is social, as each strives to outshine their rivals. Efreet society is bound by an elaborate social calendar. At any moment in Fernia, one of the efreet is hosting a grand celebration. Sometimes there's a theme or explanation for the gala--the unveiling of a new work of art, the epic burning of an old piece of art, or the thousandth anniversary of an efreeti's last rebirth. Other times, the party needs no explanation.

If an efreeti isn't hosting a gala, it's planning its next one--and always, always searching for ways to outshine every celebration that's come before. Often this is about working with the resources within the plane, pushing azers and dao to create new wonders. But efreet have vast wealth and the ability to travel the planes, and this can bring them to the Material Plane. If a celebration sports a flight of red dragons performing synchronized pyrotechnics, remember this--dragons aren't native to Fernia, and the plane doesn't have manifestations of creatures; thus, the efreeti hired those dragons from another plane. Imagine what it would take to convince dragons of Argonnessen to perform as entertainment! Efreet rarely have any reason to deal with adventurers, but if the characters do have something to offer--or if they're interesting enough simply to be invited to a party as curiosities--an efreeti can make it worth their time. An efreeti could also serve as the patron of a warlock--perhaps using the Fiend pact--giving the mortal power, but demanding that they always search for things that could give the efreeti an edge over their rivals in their endless social battles.

While efreet have much to offer, any association with an efreeti is dangerous. They abide by the letter of any contracts they make, but adventurers would be wise to make sure a contract includes safety clauses. After all, efreet are spirits of fire, and they burn things they touch. They care about nothing save their own status and amusement, and destroy lives without a thought.

There are a host of noble efreet in Fernia. Here are a few of the most prominent, including their public names they use with mortals--their Ignan names are far longer.

- **Sultan Azhalar of High Hearth.** tands at the top of the social order. He has assembled the grandest armies and enjoys displays of martial might, including exotic engines of war. His galas often involve gladiatorial matches or grand war games.
- **Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall.** stands just below Ashalar in the social order and is determined to unseat her rival. She is cultivating the friendship of several dragons. She considers herself to be a connoisseur of art, and could take an interest in the work of an artistic adventurer.
- **Pasha Raqashtar of Gold Ash.** is the most cosmopolitan of the efreet. He has many friends in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, and enjoys betting on the outcome of battles in Shavarath. His appetite for gambling could draw the adventurers into his orbit, as he might make a wager with another immortal about the outcome of a particular adventure--then seek to put a burning finger on the scales.

#### Dao

Where do the many treasures of efreet come from? Who built their glorious city of brass? The dao are the answer to both of these questions. Azer laborers keep the foundries burning, but it's the dao who pluck wondrous jewels and pure adamantine from the primal earth, and it's they who craft the grandest and most remarkable wonders. Each dao has a particular specialty, a unique style of art or artifice. While they can craft artifacts that would be the envy of any mortal artificer, their techniques can't be easily replicated. Their work has an element of arcane science, but much of what they do involves channeling the essence of Fernia itself; a dao who settles in the Material Plane will find its talents more limited.

The dao are more stoic than the fiery efreet, and don't throw extravagant parties. But they still engage in intense social competition with one another, striving to craft the most glorious creations. This doesn't necessarily mean their work is the most powerful; rather, it's about creating things that are most desired. The dao don't need gold, so the efreet usually pay them in barter, which creates a bizarre secondary market. The efreeti Raqashtar might offer a squad of elite salamander warriors in exchange for a wondrous crown; the dao has no use for them, but it knows that the efreeti Azhalar is collecting soldiers, so... 

Adventurers may seek out dao because of what they can do, but dao can also be interesting patrons. A dao may need some rare substance to complete its latest work, but it can only be obtained on the Material Plane--so it turns to adventurers to obtain it. Or a dao could even use a group of mortals as a focus group, seeking opinions on its latest work.

Here are a few notable dao:

- **Naja Ash.** sculpts fire, producing masterful artifacts and tools that channel or produce flame. She creates the majority of the azer, and she can create other elemental creatures, constructs, or unique blends between the two concepts. She's the foremost expert on elemental binding in the multiverse, though it would take a great deal to convince her to share her knowledge with mortals.
- **Sar Saeran.** creates tools of war, from personal armor and weapons to grand siege engines. The efreeti Azhalar is his best client, but all of the efreet value his peerless work. He has spent eons trying to create the perfect sword, and often seeks out legendary blades on the Material Plane--sometimes to keep, sometimes to study for a few minutes, and sometimes to destroy.
- **Brass.** is the finest architect of the dao, and is responsible for most of the grand palaces of the efreet. She's always intrigued by unusual architecture and has visited Sharn a few times to study the towers. She's also celebrated for her sculptures, and has produced everything from tiny miniatures to towering colossuses, along with magical marvels that begin as the former, then transform into something far larger, like *figurines of wondrous power*.

#### Lesser Elementals

Fernia is home to raw fire and earth elementals (though these can also be found in Lamannia), abstract spirits that want nothing more than to burn or surge. These primordial creatures are largely ignored by the efreet and dao, and they're driven by pure instinct. Elementals are Fernia's most common inhabitants; an efreeti wouldn't be a lord without subjects to lord over, and these lesser elementals serve that role. While humanoid in form, they're deeply alien, immortal spirits shaped by their element and driven by singular purpose. An azer lives for the forge, and a mephit delights in mischief. Most lesser elementals are content as long as they have the opportunity to pursue their purpose, but occasionally a lesser elemental unexpectedly develops a quirk that drives it to pursue a new purpose.

The population of these elementals is limited, and thus their service is valuable to the efreet and dao. The efreet and dao often barter the service of their elemental subjects, sending them to allied or rival courts. Typically this doesn't matter to the elementals, but there have been a few cases of salamanders rebelling against a new lord or mephits playing tricks on their new comrades.

Azers, mephits, and salamanders are the most common elementals, though others might be encountered somewhere in this plane.

***Azers.*** The dao craft **azers** from bronze and bring them to life using the primordial spark of Fernia. They are tireless laborers who love working with fire and metals. Dao may create the greatest wonders, but the azers do remarkable work--and far more of it. Azer are naturally gifted artisans, and can be assigned to any sort of task that involves fire. However, there are few things more miserable than an azer baking bread instead of working with brass.

***Mephits.*** When encountered in the wilds, mephits are capricious tricksters and their "pranks" can make life miserable for planar travelers. However, those found in the service of the efreet are generally more polite and well mannered--though this can quickly change if there's an opportunity for mischief too good to pass up.

***Salamanders.*** The primary servants of the efreet, **salamanders** can be found serving as soldiers or performing domestic tasks. For every salamander officer carrying an ornate spear, there's a salamander butler carrying a brass tray. Salamanders are extremely proud, and within their ranks there is great competition over rank and position. Most are dismissive of mortals, but they can be jealous of adventurers who receive too much attention or favor.

#### Fiends and Celestials

The fiends and celestials of Fernia embody specific aspects of the concept of fire. Fire is an integral part of their appearance; they may have burning eyes, orange-red skin, or wings and halos formed of flame.

***Angels.*** represent the comfort fire offers: its life-giving warmth, the light that holds back the shadows. The angels of Fernia are typically devas or other lesser angels, and they generally seek to assist and comfort travelers when they can.

***Demons.*** reflect the terrifying destructive power of fire, the wildfire that can't be contained and the spark that brings down a mansion. They are wild and violent, and it's rarely a good thing when adventurers cross paths with them. Demons yearn to burn all wondrous things. Sometimes this leads them to target the grand mansion of an efreeti, but during coterminous periods, they can also influence untended flames in the Material Plane, or occasionally manipulate mortals into carelessness with fire. Common demons include quasits (malevolent counterparts to the elemental mephits), vrocks with burning wings, and terrifying balors.

***Devils.*** represent the intentional use of fire as a weapon or to inspire fear--the burning iron used in torture, the screams of those dying on burning battlefields. Devils are rare and exceptionally cruel. They thrive both on causing pain and suffering in Fernia, and cajoling mortals into acts of arson or fiery torture in the Material Plane. Like demons, they can usually only influence mortals when the planes are coterminous, but occasionally a Fernian devil manages to slip through fire into Eberron. Imps, barbed devils, and pit fiends can all be found in Fernia.

### Layers

Fernia is dominated by the vast layer known as the Sea of Flame. Where the sky can be seen, it's almost always obscured by ash and smoke. Its smaller layers embody specific concepts, such as infernos and campfires. These can usually be reached through burning circles on the islands in the Sea of Fire, or via tunnels in the Deep Halls.

#### The Sea of Fire

This is a seemingly endless ocean of magma, larger than any single sea in Eberron. Ultimately, the Sea of Fire wraps around on itself; head north from High Hearth and you'll eventually find it again, but it may take a month of travel. There are islands in the sea, spires and mesas of basalt and obsidian--some are inhabited, but many are barren and empty.

Salamanders sail the blazing sea in ships forged from blackened steel, and azers fly over it in balloons woven from brass. Many of the islands hold teleportation circles traced in continual flame, with a word inscribed in Ignan indicating the destination. Any spellcaster with proficiency in Arcana can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to activate a portal--though unless they speak Ignan, they won't know where it leads. Here are a few noteworthy destinations.

***The City of Brass.*** The sole metropolis in Fernia, the City of Brass is the glorious city of the efreet, a place of marvels. Here, a towering statue of an efreeti holds a sphere of continual flame the size of an airship. The statue reshapes itself to match the appearance of the efreeti who currently dominates society; both the statue and whichever efreeti it depicts are known as the Sultan. Currently, the Sultan is Azhalar of High Hearth.

All efreet have mansions in the City of Brass, though at any given time, many dwell within their island estates. Likewise, there are always a few dao in residence showing off their latest creations and taking new commissions. The streets are filled with mephits and salamanders. Visiting mortals are a curiosity, but most elements are too busy to take much time on them. The City of Brass is ringed with teleportation circles, linking it to all of the estates and major foundries.

***Efreeti Estates.*** Each of the noble efreet have a sprawling palace or mansion on an island in the Sea of Fire. While not so grand as the City of Brass, these estates are studies in opulence, filled with dao-crafted wonders and sculptures of metal and flame.

***Foundries.*** Foundry islands are models of industry. Some are focused primarily on physical engineering, with vast gears and wheels slowly turning, and chains rising and falling. Others reflect arcane industry, with blazing glyphs and fields of shimmering energy. Here the azers work at all hours, producing both mundane, martial, and magical goods for the efreet and their servants.

***Deep Halls.*** Under the foundries, tunnels extend down below the Sea of Fire into the earth below. These are the domains of the dao. Like the foundries above them, each has a distinct style tied to the sensibilities of the dao who dwells there. Streams of lava and pools of fire run through the halls, along with veins of metal and minerals. While not as luxurious as the estates of the efreeti, these often showcase the wondrous creations of the dao in residence; adventurers could find a hall whose walls are decorated with a thousand swords, or a brass garden filled with cunning construct songbirds. But some dao are paranoid, and deep halls can also contain a host of powerful and deadly traps.

#### Infernos

Infernos are isolated layers that showcase a particular act of destruction by fire. One inferno is a burning city, where devils direct bombardment and demons dance about, spreading the flames within. In another layer, a lone balor oversees the devastation of an ancient forest. These fires never end; parts of the layer are rebuilt even as others are consumed, and the inferno continues forever.

#### Campfires

These small layers reflect the comfort fire can offer. A campfire layer can be a literal campfire, a lonely light out in the darkest wilderness. Another campfire layer is an inn called the First Hearth, where the angelic barkeep Ashe offers warm drinks around the fireplace from which the inn takes its name. Campfire layers are safe havens, and a perfect place for travelers to rest.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few of the ways Fernia can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Fernia often share one or more of the plane's universal properties. Those with Deadly Heat often have unusual volcanic or tectonic activity, and are generally shunned. However, House Cannith is always searching for Fernian zones with the Fires of Industry property; in addition to providing advantage on tool checks, these zones often allow artificers to craft enchantments that can't be replicated elsewhere (especially those tied to evocation and flame). A Fernian manifest zone can provide an unexpected haven in an arctic environment, or provide unusual geothermal benefits. In Karrnath, the town of Ember--on the edge of the Icetop Mountains--is renowned for its pleasant climate and thermal pools.

#### Coterminous and Remote

While Fernia is coterminous, temperatures rise sharply, and warmer regions that would normally be safe can become extremely hot, taking on the Deadly Heat, Empowered Fire, and Burning Bright properties of the plane. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense flame can find themselves pulled through to Fernia itself.

When Fernia is remote, intense heat loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat, as well as on saving throws against spells that deal fire damage.

Traditionally, Fernia is coterminous once every five years during the month of Lharvion, and it's remote once every five years during the month of Zarantyr (exactly two and a half years after it's coterminous).

#### Fernian Artifacts

The dao and the foundries of Fernia produce a vast array of wonders. Many of their creations are effectively trinkets, such as a gold model of a dragon that breathes actual fire. Others are far grander, such as *figurines of wondrous power*. While many Fernian artifacts relate to fire in some way--*wands of fireball*, *flame tongue* swords--they aren't limited to fire or evocation. Fernian items are often made from brass, obsidian, or basalt, but the dao work with all metals.

Two additional resources from Fernia are *cold fire* and *Fernian ashes*. *Cold fire* is a form of *continual flame* that occurs naturally in Fernia; the flames have the texture of warm putty. *Fernian ashes* are created from the wood of rare trees found only in the Sea of Fire. *Fernian ashes* are a potent component of magic items tied to the evocation school. In addition, if a spellcaster discards a pinch of *Fernian ashes* while casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, their spell deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. Both *Fernian ashes* and *cold fire* can occasionally be harvested from Fernian manifest zones, though not all trees will produce *Fernian ashes.*

### Fernian Stories

Fernia is difficult to reach and dangerous to visit, but here are a few ideas that might spark adventures related to that plane.

***The Life of the Party.*** The Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall is determined to unseat the Sultan Azhalar with her next gala. And what's in fashion at the moment? Adventurers. The Pasha whisks the adventurers to Fernia, promising to reward them well if they make the gala a success--and to throw them into the Sea of Fire should they fail her. Can the characters shine at a party of efreet and dao? Do they know which fork to use, especially when one of them is on fire? What happens when Azhalar's salamander general challenges a party member to a duel?

***The Infernal Machine.*** The adventurers stumble across an Emerald Claw camp. These Seekers are working with the dao Sar Saraen, who's building them a devastating explosive device capable of leveling a city. Can the adventurers find out why Saraean is working with the Emerald Claw? If the dao is being compelled, can they free him? If it's part of a negotiation, can they make a better offer? And what will they do if they end up with the completed bomb?

***The Back Door.*** The adventurers find a curious brass key. When inserted into a door, it transforms that door into a portal to the First Hearth, an inn in Fernia. Who does the key belong to? How often can its power be used? The barkeep Ashe is always happy to see a few new faces, but who else will the adventurers meet at the bar?

## Irian: The Eternal Dawn

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/165%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

In Irian, birds sing in a fertile valley, while a group of settlers work together to raise their first home. Moving further in, you find the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets. There are dozens of layers in Irian, and each one is a vision of life triumphant. Irian is the dawn that inevitably banishes even the darkest night, the promise of spring triumphing over the coldest winter. It's the bastion of hope, the promise that life always find a way.

In his *Planar Codex,* Dorius Alyre ir'Korran calls Irian the Plane of Light, and indeed, its light is so prevalent that there's no full darkness within Irian. But it's also the plane of life, the source of positive energy, the force that sustains life and underlies most healing magic.

#### Universal Properties

The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. Irian has the following universal properties.

***Radiant Power.*** When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points or deals radiant damage, it's treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

***Necrotic Void.*** In order to cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

***Pure Light.*** There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness only reduces the lighting to dim light.

***Life Triumphant.*** Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This has no effect on undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.

***The Light of Life.*** The light of Irian restores vitality, granting the following benefits to all living creatures. These have no effect on undead or constructs; however, undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal, benefit from these effects as if they were living creatures.

- On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a living creature with at least 1 hit point regains 3 (1d6) hit points.
- A living creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn.
- A living creature has resistance to poison damage.
- A living creature has advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and fear.

***Standard Time.*** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

#### Planar Rebirth

Most of the planes are fixed in their form; for example, every mortal brings new dreams to Dal Quor, but the plane's structure doesn't change. Mabar is an exception: the Endless Night steals and corrupts fragments of other planes, adding them to its layers. Left unchecked, Mabar would consume reality. But as the Endless Night consumes, the Eternal Dawn creates. Whenever Mabar tears a fragment from another plane, a new planar seed appears in Irian. Initially, this is a small layer, populated by embers and lumi, that has Irian's planar properties. Over time, the layer grows and evolves, and the environment and its inhabitants take on the appearance of the void it's to fill. Little by little, it loses the properties of Irian and adopts the properties of its destination plane; when it finally loses the Light of Life property, its ties to Irian are severed and it fully becomes part of the other plane, replacing the region lost to Mabar.

The planar seed is rarely a perfect match for the fragment that was lost. The embers take the form of local life, but especially for fragments torn from the Material Plane, a planar seed doesn't replace sentient creatures or buildings; it simply restores land and wildlife. If the Mourning had been the work of Mabar--which is unlikely for many reasons, but not impossible--Irian wouldn't restore the people killed in the Mourning or the destroyed structures, but it would restore life to the land and make it a welcoming environment.

In most planes, immortals can't reproduce, but they're reborn if they die, and their numbers remain constant. Irian breaks that rule, because it creates new immortals to replace those corrupted by Mabar. These begin as lumi and angels, but as the seed loses its properties, these immortals evolve into the denizens of that plane, drawing their personalities from the template for the new immortals. Irian makes no judgment about the spaces it fills, and it may create a squad of bloodthirsty demons when it replaces a lost fragment of Shavarath. These seed immortals can't leave their layer until it's fully bound to their final plane, so they can't wreak havoc in Irian, but it would be quite a surprise for nosy adventurers that stumble into that layer!

The creation of seeds is an important drive for the inhabitants of Irian. Immortals monitor and guide the formation of the seeds, while lumi tend the embers and prepare to *become* inhabitants of the new plane. Irian immortals rarely interfere in other planes, because what they're already doing is the most important task they could perform.

### Denizens

Most inhabitants of Irian fall into one of the following categories.

#### Embers

Irian is bursting with life. Songbirds, rabbits, and other creatures roam the Garden. The streets of the Amaranthine City are filled with happy people. But the Garden never has too many rabbits, and there's no risk of the citizens of the Amaranthine City starving--or needing to go on strike to prevent it. Sometimes, if you glimpse one out of the corner of your eye, you might see them differently, as an outline of pale white light--a glowing shadow.

These are manifestations, not living creatures. Called embers, each one is linked to a spark--a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature. Through this connection, mortals draw inspiration and hope, and remain linked to the positive energy that flows to and from all living things. An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn't fully conscious and doesn't have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal's brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds. There are many more sparks in Irian than there are embers at any given moment; Irian simply dips into the pool of sparks, manifesting as many embers as the scene calls for, shaping the light of each soul into something that looks like them.

Embers don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. They follow basic scripts, but can't improvise and don't have much knowledge beyond what they need for their role. As a rule, embers are happy, for they don't know any other way to be. An ember can't be truly killed; its body dissolves, but the spark that fueled it remains safely within Irian's deep well of light.

While adventuring in Irian, you might see an ember that resembles you--but it won't recognize you, and might not even appear the same age. This ember is merely your light-shadow, manifested by Irian and channeling your life force. It holds the essence of your best moments and emotions, the light within you that drives you to goodness--but merely as a spark, not the fire of a living creature.

#### Lumi

When a mortal dies and their soul goes to Dolurrh, the thread connecting them to Irian is severed. Any ember fueled by their spark dissolves and the spark--the essence of the hopes and brightest moments of the mortal's life--begins to fade. But the sparks of the dead can merge together before they're lost completely, creating a new, unique entity--a lumi, formed from the same positive energy as the embers, but possessing true consciousness and life. Unlike the embers, who aren't fully conscious or aware of the memories they hold, lumi are sentient creatures, each with a unique identity, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives. So adventurers may meet a lumi who recognizes them, and who has a few memories and traits of a fallen friend.

Lumi appear to be formed from solidified light, and generally take a body shape similar to the strongest of the sparks that formed them--usually those of sentient creatures. Their most distinctive feature is their head--a sphere of light suspended a few inches above their torso. Normally this is pure light, but with conscious effort, a lumi can sculpt and maintain a face. Their statistics can be represented by the **priest** in the *Monster Manual* (or an exceptionally powerful one might use the statistics of the **war priest** in *Volo's Guide to Monsters*), but they don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, they don't age, and they're immune to poison and disease. When a lumi reaches 0 hit points, its body dissolves and its sparks fade. If an angel of Irian is nearby, it can consume these sparks; this won't save the lumi, but at least those memories are preserved. While most lumi are humanoids, there may be lumi formed from the sparks of other creatures, like giants or dragons, that dwell in layers of their own kind.

Lumi serve as the caretakers of the embers, and believe that by helping the embers play their roles, they're strengthening the light in the mortals the embers are connected to. Lumi help develop and maintain the planar seeds, and some even surrender their identity in order to become new creatures within that seed; they believe that in doing this, they're sowing the new layer with light. On rare occasions, lumi travel to other planes in service of the Architects. They are brave and compassionate, seeking always to spread hope, and ever prepared to lay down their lives for the greater good. Lumi can defend themselves, but they prefer to inspire others when possible, rather than resort to violence.

#### Celestials

Irian's immortals are spirits of light and hope. Irian is noteworthy for being the home of the ki-rin. These majestic creatures often act as emissaries for the Architects. Each planar seed has a ki-rin assigned to monitor it, help the lumi, and ease transition.

Irian is also home to angels. Not as violent as the angels of Shavarath or as individualistic as the angels of Syrania, the angels of Irian embody the general principles of hope and compassion. Irian devas assist the lumi and help sustain the different layers; they are the knights and scholars of the Amaranthine City. Devas often change their form to play multiple roles within a layer, and adventurers may think that they've encountered multiple people, when in fact it's a single deva. Meanwhile, planetars act as champions and ministers, and each of the Architects has a single solar that serves as its right hand.

The angels of Irian have wings formed of light, which they can conceal if they wish. In their true form, they're luminescent humanoids of indeterminate species, but can choose to appear to mortals as a generic member of the viewer's species. Devas also possesses the ability to change into specific forms at will.

#### The Architects

The Architects are the most powerful spirits of Irian. Each embodies an aspect of the plane, and oversees a region within it, as discussed in the "Layers" section. They're unique celestials with great wisdom and power, but most of their time and energy is devoted to the planar seeds--guiding the growth of the seed, smoothing over problems, and adding a few personal touches. Planar seeds emerge within an Architect's realm, expanding until they break off and join their new planes.

The power of the Architects is largely bound to their realms. They can't directly intervene in the Material Plane, though they can work with warlocks (as Celestial patrons) or send lumi. Often this involves the reintegration of a planar seed, or examining regions where Mabar has removed a fragment.

### Layers

It's always morning in Irian; the skies are clear, the sun is fixed in the sky, and the moon Barrakas is faintly visible. The plane contains many layers, and it's always growing new ones. While the setting of a layer varies--a verdant valley, a growing city, a newly established farm--the story is always about life, growth, and hope. Things are growing, people are prosperous, and the future is bright. While there are many natural environments in Irian, it's this optimism that differentiates them from those of Lamannia. Irian is a celebration of life; Lamannia focuses on the untamable primordial power of nature, and often feels more threatening and wild.

The layers are linked in realms, each of which is bound to one of the Architects. The denizens and themes of a layer reflect the influence of that Architect, so all of the layers of the Garden have a focus on rustic nature, while those tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its rising imperial power. Some layers are bounded by physical barriers, but most either loop back on themselves or end in walls of warm mist--anyone who wanders into the fog reemerges elsewhere in the layer. Within realms, layers are often connected by physical portals like a massive gate or a pool of light. Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you're in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.

Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they're small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they're to become. Thus, you could stumble into a layer that replicates a piece of Dolurrh's Catacombs or represents conflict in Shavarath. However, these layers aren't fully developed--once they are, they move onto their destination plane--so Irian's seed of the Catacombs of Dolurrh won't have the entrapping effect of Dolurrh itself.

Here are three examples of realms, but there are many more.

#### The Amaranthine City: Growth

This immense metropolis fills an entire layer. The Amaranthine City is the capital of an empire in its first bloom of glory. Gilded banners catch the wind. Armored angels and pegasi patrols pass overhead. People laugh in the streets, healthy and happy. Artisans create a mosaic depicting glorious victories. While this is an empire, the message isn't about oppression, but one of *potential*. This is an empire where all the citizens are prosperous and all have equal opportunities. People are proud, the city is full of wonders, and the future is bright.

The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Irian. Its Dawn Empress is the first and greatest of the Architects. Her defining principle is growth, the opportunity to reach your full potential, and all layers of her realm reflect this. Her empire isn't driven by conquest, but rather by exploration--discovering new lands and opportunities, just as mortals can always find new talents within and opportunities beyond. The Dawn Empress is a celestial figure wreathed in light, though she can assume the shape of any humanoid or angel. She presides over festivals and tends the needs of her people, but she spends much of her time focused on the cultivation of her planar seeds. She occasionally works with mortals, typically warlocks; while she may have missions tied to planar seeds or to clashing with agents of Mabar, she also gives her agents tasks that are designed to help them with their own growth and evolution.

Layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of expansion and discovery. These layers may hold outposts in otherwise-uninhabited lands filled with wonders of nature, or they might hold prosperous farms and estates, inhabited by embers, with lumi and devas helping to drive the theme.

#### The Garden: Life

The Garden lives up to its name; it's a vast zoological garden filled with foliage. It contains every plant that can be found in the Material Plane, along with many that can't. There are winding paths, peaceful pools, wondrous topiaries, and complicated hedge mazes. In contrast to the wilds of Lamannia, this is very carefully cultivated. The Garden is suffused with a sense of peace, beauty, and the wondrous things life can create.

The Garden is the realm of the Gardener, an Architect whose principle is life. He's a blend of angel and plant--more humanoid than treant, but with skin of bark, a beard of leaves, and a crown of flowers. Like all of the Architects, he's devoted to his planar seeds, but he also spends time wandering the garden, both tending it and appreciating its wonders. He apprecates those who nurture and heal others, and this is the behavior he expects of any mortals he associates with.

The many layers of the Garden realm showcase various elements of fertility and the triumph of life. There are a few layers that are slightly darker than the rest of Irian, though still suffused with dim light in their darkest corners--these reflect the principle that life overcomes hardship. The message of the ruined castle isn't to dwell on the destruction, but to see the flowers blooming on the walls. Most of the embers in the region take animal form, and **ki-rin** are the most comon celestials.

#### The Refuge: Hope

The Refuge is a vast fortress-monastery, though it has aspects of a spa as well. It's filled with tranquil groves, soothing baths, and places to rest and reflect. The fortress walls don't represent potential conflict, but rather speak to the absolute security of the place--within its walls, you are safe from all threats. The Refuge holds healers who can treat your injuries, mediators who can talk through problems, and sages who may not know the answers you need, but can point you in the right direction. This isn't a place where adventures occur; it's where you recover from your injuries and plan your next move, knowing that you're safe and that there are answers to every problem.

Araam is the Architect of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope. She's a wise advisor, and while she may not always have answers, she helps people look at their problems in new ways and see that all problems can be solved. She's the finest healer in Irian, and there are few injuries she cannot heal or curses she cannot break. There's no monetary cost for the services of the Refuge, but Araam charges thoes who benefit to give hope to someone who needs it; they won't be allowed to return to the Refuge until that debt is paid. While Araam isn't a god, a Life cleric could say that their class features come from training in the Refute and are tied to the power of Irian.

While not all layers of Araam's realm provide the security and succor of the Refuge itself, they all can provide comfort and hope. They don't have the absolute peace of Syrania, but they make people *feel* there's hope. Irian has no match for the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, so if you're looking for commerce, the Azure Sky has more options. But for adventurers who seek a relaxing vacation in the planes, the Refuge is unparalleled.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few of the ways Irian can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Irian are wellsprings of positive energy. Plants and animals thrive in these zones, while people are less likely to dwell on negative emotions and find it easier to embrace hope and joy. Irian zones often have one or more of the plane's universal properties. Irian zones with the Radiant Power property support spells of healing and may enable rituals or support eldritch machines that can't be built anywhere else. In particular, the City of the Dead in Aerenal is built on a strong Irian manifest zone, which sustains the deathless councilors.

Irian zones rarely extend the full swift healing effect of Irian's Light of Life property. However, all of the following benefits are common when in an Irian zone:

- You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks.
- Whenever you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points, use the highest number possible for each die.
- You have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.

For all these reasons, Irian manifest zones are a valuable natural resource, and often become the foundations of villages, towns, or Jorasco healing houses. Irian manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, and traveling to Irian usually requires *plane shift* or similar magic.

#### Coterminous and Remote

Life blossoms when Irian is coterminous. Health and fertility are enhanced, positive energy flows freely, and living creatures are infused with an abundant sense of hope. While Irian is coterminous, the Radiant Power property applies across Eberron and all creatures have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.

When Irian is remote, colors seem to fade and a sense of psychic numbness pervades the world. All creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against fear and resistance to radiant damage. In addition, any effect that restores hit points--including spells and spending Hit Dice--only restores half the usual amount. However, creatures still regain full hit points after completing a long rest.

Traditionally, Irian is coterminous for ten days in the month of Eyre and remote for ten days in the month of Sypheros. These effects occur once every three years; the remote cycle comes a year and a half after it is coterminous.

#### Irian Artifacts

The Aereni harness Irian's energy, using it to create many of their tools, but industry isn't one of the core concepts of Irian and relics from the plane itself are relatively rare. Whether from the plane itself or simply drawing on its power, items tie to the effects of positive energy: healing, dealing radiant damage, generating light, bringing hope, or overcoming fear. A scroll that provides a single trip to the Refuge would be an invaluable boon.

Plants that grow in Irian manifest zones can often have remarkable properties. Many of of Aerenal's exotic lumbers--notably livewood--only grow in Irian zones. Araam's crown is a flower with remarkable medicinal properties; House Jorasco requires a steady supply of it for their healing potions. Another flower, dawn's glory, has euphoric properties and is used to make a drug often called fool's hope or liquid courage. This drug grants temporary immunity to fear, but with the side effect of encouraging dangerous and foolhardy behavior; it's strictly illegal in Sharn, due to the risk of users jumping off bridges.

### Irian Stories

At first glance, Irian can seem much too good to be true. Its inhabitants are benevolent, and it heals you every round. What's the catch?

At the most basic level, there isn't a catch. It's the literal embodiment of light triumphing over darkness and the power of hope. While certain diseases could be seen as tied to the concept of growth, Irian doesn't have a dark side in the same way as, for example, Daanvi. However, there are a few obvious limitations. It's not an easy plane to reach, as its manifest zones don't act as portals. So the Refuge is a perfect shelter for anyone who can reach it, but you have to find a way to get there. And with the Refuge in particular, you get one free visit, but after that, Araam expects you to help someone else before she'll welcome you again.

There are a few ideas you can explore. The first is that unfounded hope can be dangerous. A lumi or deva might spread hope because that's its nature--but in doing so, may convince people they have a chance to defeat an enemy that they should actually be fleeing from. You can also explore mortal forces abusing the power of Irian--Jorasco seizing a manifest zone to grow Araam's crown or criminals trafficking in fool's hope.

***A Wound That Will Not Heal.*** Perhaps a villain wields a Mabaran scythe that deals wounds that can't be healed by magic or rest, or a hag lays a terrible curse on an adventurer. It's said that all wounds and woes can be cured in the Refuge of Irian. But how will the adventurers reach the Eternal Dawn, and what will Araam ask of them in return?

***Beyond the Grave.*** When the adventurers cross paths with a lumi, it hails them. It holds the memory of a hero who once saved the life of one of the characters, and that debt was never repaid; the lumi asks them to honor that by helping with its current quest. This could be a debt incurred during the party's travels, or even something from a character's backstory; you could ask a player to tell you about a time someone saved their character's life, and let them add depth to the debt.

***A New Realm.*** A barren region on the border of two nations or rival clans suddenly becomes a wondrous, fertile oasis. This is the result of a planar seed taking root. In addition to whatever remarkable plants or resources it holds, it's become an Irian manifest zone--a valuable resource. Dispute over the territory could have disastrous consequences; can the adventurers prevent bloodshed? And has the Architect hidden any secrets or artifacts in this seed land?

## Kythri: The Churning Chaos

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/169%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

It's hard to keep a consistent rhythm in Kythri. It takes effort to maintain any pattern of behavior; without even thinking about it, people in Kythri adjust their behavior to avoid repetition. This is the essence of Kythri. On the one hand it's a vision of chaos, but it's also about change, adapting to overcome the unexpected, and challenging traditions.

Kythri is commonly imagined as utterly unstable, with landscapes taking shape only to boil away within moments. And this is true of the heart of the realm, known as the Sea of Chaos. But at the edges of the sea, there are islands that linger. The environments of these Shifting Islands steadily and constantly change; a vast desert might be a lush rainforest in a few hours. But the land itself remains constant, and creatures can live on these islands, adapting to the endlessly changing environment.

While Kythri constantly changes, its elements are usually natural. A jungle becomes a desert, a blizzard becomes a sandstorm--but it's comprised of sand, not tiny marble busts of King Boranel. This distinguishes Kythri from Xoriat or Dal Quor; while constantly changing, it's generally change between plausible options, unlike the unreal environments of the Realm of Madness and the Region of Dreams.

#### Universal Properties

All things change in Kythri, even time and the future. The only thing that's truly reliable is that nothing's reliable.

***Broken Rhythms.*** A creature can't take the exact same action on two consecutive turns. If it previously stood still, it must move. If it previously moved, it can stand still or move a different distance. A creature can cast a spell in two consecutive turns, but it can't be the same spell. A creature can attack on two consecutive turns, but the second attack must be described as substantially different in style from the one before.

***Fluid in Form.*** When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if it has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is doubled.

***Embrace the Unknown.*** In order to cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 12 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. Divination spells cast on other planes can't affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.

***The Odds Are Odd.*** If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1 or a 2, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 19 or 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC, and is considered a critical hit. If a creature has an ability or item that increases its normal range of critical hits--such as the Champion fighter's Improved Critical--its range increases by 1.

***Constant Change.*** Nothing remains exactly the same in Kythri. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe what's changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish Aundairian design when it was originally Karrnathi. You could choose for the change to be physical--your skin, hairstyle, or sex--or mental--you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the Sovereign Host. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins won't turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impact--for example, if your cleric's faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect that--discuss the possibility with your DM.

***Chaotic Time.*** Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.

### Denizens

Most of Kythri's denizens fall into one of three categories.

#### Wild Things

The islands of Kythri are inhabited. But how can a creature survive in an environment that can be a desert today and a glacier tomorrow? The answer, of course, is that the creature must change with the environment. Kythri's islands include some creatures that appear to be natural beasts, though they change as the region around them does; the wolf in the forest becomes an arctic wolf when the land turns into a glacier, and turns into a jackal when it's a desert. Even beyond their practical changes for survival, Kythrian creatures might be constantly shifting their plumage, behavior, and more fundamental biology, whether from moment to moment or day to day.

However, not all of Kythri's wild things transform into familiar forms. Part of the plane's core concept is evolving in response to change, and Kythri is home to many creatures that blend the features of two or more natural beasts: monstrosities such as the owlbear, griffon, and chimera. It's commonly accepted that at least some of these monstrosities first appeared in Kythri, and that they first appeared in Eberron either by passing through portals or due to the influence of manifest zones.

Just as the environments of Kythri are chaotic but largely blend natural elements, Kythrian monstrosities typically blend the forms of natural creatures. While there are hippogriffs and griffons in Kythri, inherently alien creatures like kruthiks and gricks aren't found here. The wild things of Kythri also include natural shapechangers, notably a wide variety of mimics--even colossal ones that can assume the shape of natural features such as hills or mountains. It's quite likely the mimics of Eberron either immigrated from Kythri or were created by its influence, much like the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion use the blood of the kar'lassa bound to Kythri to create their plasmids.

Unlike other planes where these wild things would likely be manifestations, the wild things of Kythri are mortal creatures. They live, reproduce, and die following (mostly) natural means, and have to find sustenance and shelter in their islands. Between the strange flow of time and unusual environments, this can lead to dramatic surges in populations or sudden extinctions. However, the plane itself seeds new life into islands that somehow become depopulated, and if all the griffons in Kythri were to die, new ones would eventually evolve. So even though Kythri doesn't have manifestations, it ensures a steady stream of mortals exist--and when they die, it replaces them.

#### Slaadi

The slaadi are native immortals of Kythri. Though they do reproduce (in strange and disturbing ways) and can die of mortal ailments, they're defined as immortals because their population remains constant. Whenever a new slaad is born--whatever the method of its creation--an existing slaad dies, seemingly at random. And whenever a slaad is killed, a new one is formed. So while they seem to share many of the traits of mortals, they can never be wiped out even if they die en masse, and even if a blue slaad transforms a village of humans into slaadi with the chaos phage, the overall number of slaadi doesn't increase.

The slaadi are the only native civilization of Kythri. They aren't a monolithic society; some live in massive cities, while others are tiny rustic communities. Each slaad community has its own distinct culture and a grand name, and the Slaad Cultures table provides a few examples of these--but there are many more, and they're constantly changing. The grand city of Cornerstone may be the seat of the brutal Concordance of Iron today, and the Enlightened Lyceum League a month later. These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren't instant; there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and revolution in between a change. The scope of a community won't change--Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village--but the structures of the community shift. Under the Concordance of Iron, Cornerstone is filled with brutalist iron towers, while the Cornerstone of the Lyceum League is filled with slender glass spires.

The slaadi themselves retain their core forms while their buildings and government change. Red slaadi are always red toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are squat and heavy. Kythri's influence can also cause slaadi to change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating particular colors--a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos phage, creating red or green slaadi--but a green slaad could go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership frequently changes, because it's based on color, not personality.

Because slaad cultures change so rapidly, they rarely enact plans beyond their own communities, though cities occasionally clash. Some weeks they seek to exterminate the githzerai, and other weeks, to ally with them. You never know what you'll get.

#### Githzerai

The githzerai aren't natives of Kythri, and their presence is an act of defiance: through unparalleled mental discipline, they create bastions of order in the heart of chaos. If they seek order, why don't they dwell in Daanvi? It's not that they simply desire order, but to strengthen their will by imposing it on a reality that absolutely defies it. The struggle is the purpose. Beyond this, they're served by the fact that even great powers can't scry into Kythri. The "Eberron and the Gith" sidebar explains how the githzerai came to Kythri and what they seek to accomplish.

The githzerai don't dwell on the Shifting Islands of Kythri. Instead, they've created their own islands in the Sea of Chaos: vast monastery vessels the size of small towns, moving through the eddies of chaos and defying transformation. The githzerai devote themselves to meditation and self-improvement, with little interest in what transpires beyond their monasteries. They have no particular love of outsiders--they consider all creatures of Eberron to be warped shadows of their stolen reality--but neither are they inherently hostile. A persuasive group of adventurers could find brief shelter in a githzerai monastery, especially if they bring something interesting to trade or have compelling stories to share. However, should the outsiders offend the githzerai, they'll feel no remorse in eliminating them; there's nothing evil in shining light to dispel a shadow.

> ##### Eberron and the Gith
>
>Long ago, a proud empire was crushed by the daelkyr. But this wasn't the Empire of Dhakaan, but a nation of gifted psychics who lived in towers of crysteel and sentira. Dyrrn the Corruptor transformed their champions into the first illithids, using them as living weapons to subjugate their own people. When defeat was inevitable, the great leader Gith led a planar exodus, fleeing into Kythri. The Churning Chaos hid the refugees from pursuit, and through absolute discipline, they imposed stability upon chaos.
>
>Once the refugees regained their strength, a bitter divide split their people. Zerthimon the Wise maintained that the people of Gith should remain within Kythri. He believed mental discipline was the ultimate key to victory and that, in time, they could gain the power to reclaim their reality. But Gith was a warrior, and her followers yearned for battle. They wanted to build their strength and resources by raiding every layer of reality until they found a way to destroy Xoriat.
>
>This situation remains today. The githzerai dwell in their monastery vessels in Kythri, gaining strength through the endless imposition of order upon chaos. The githyanki dwell in vast fortress-ships the size of cities, anchored in the trackless wastes of the Astral Plane, but their raiders can attack any plane. They slaughter devils in Shavarath and pillage the grand galas of Fernia. At any time, a githyanki warship could attack a major city in Khorvaire; it's up to the DM if this has ever happened before, or if the githyanki have left Eberron alone. Alternately, a githyanki merchant could be a recurring NPC, showing up and offering items pillaged from across the planes. Where the githzerai are serene and disciplined, the githyanki are passionate and aggressive. All gith despise the daelkyr and slaughter illithids whenever they can, and they could be curious and unexpected allies against a cult of the Dragon Below.
>
>Hearing this tale, one might well ask: where are the gith from? They're from Eberron--but not the Eberron that exists today. They came from a world surrounded by the Ring of Siberys, but there were no humans or elves on their Eberron. According to the githzerai, when the daelkyr completed their work on Eberron, they wiped the gith world from existence and created a new reality. If this is true, they may have done this countless times... and if they break the Gatekeeper seals, they could do it again. What the githzerai ultimately hope to achieve is to reassert their reality onto the Material Plane.
>
>It's possible that the gith are deluded about all of this. Even if the gith myth is true, it's doubtful the githzerai will ever have the strength to rewrite reality. But can it be entirely dismissed? Note that the draconic allies of the githyanki are descended from dragons from the gith Eberron; they have no loyalty to Argonnessen, and could be a curious wild card.
>
>Time moves strangely in Kythri and the Astral Plane, and the gith could've been dwelling in Kythri and raiding reality for thousands of years--or it could be that from their perspective, the destruction of reality was barely a century ago. Are the githyanki led by an ancient lich-queen, or by Gith herself?
>

#### Greater Powers?

No one knows if there's a greater power shaping Kythri. The death slaadi are powerful beings, but there's no known equivalent to Dolurrh's Queen of the Dead or Dal Quor's il-Lashtavar. Some sages assert that there must be a consciousness at the heart of the Sea of Chaos, a sentience behind the chaos, but if so, its presence has never been proven.

### Layers

Unlike many planes, Kythri isn't divided into layers. Its structure is closer to that of Dal Quor; it has a planar core, with islands of reality suspended within the Sea of Chaos. The difference is that the core of Dal Quor is stable--while in Kythri, the closer you get to the heart of the sea, the more tumultuous it becomes.

There are many slaad communities spread across the Shifting Islands, and at least half a dozen githzerai monastery vessels in the Sea of Chaos. Cornerstone and Zertherun IV are examples that can be used as inspiration.

#### The Sea of Chaos

Space has little meaning in the Sea of Chaos. Matter, distance, and gravity are in constant flux. Lands and creatures appear and dissolve within moments. There are waves of lightning, streams of lava, and hurricane winds constantly shifting direction. While the elements may be mundane--unlike the surreal vistas of Xoriat--size has little meaning. A thousand-foot-long dragon turtle might appear, try to swallow travelers, then become an island.

Travel through the Sea of Chaos is driven by pure will. Travelers must impose the concept of motion and distance on the environment using great mental focus, while also protecting their vessel from both the destructive forces and from being transformed. The DM could reflect this journey with a series of ability checks, or simply require the adventurers to have a captain and vessel capable of making the trip before they try to cross the sea. Regardless, to successfully travel, the adventurers must know where they want to go; without a destination to serve as a conceptual anchor, they'll quickly crash on a random Shifting Island.

#### The Shifting Islands

There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard. The DM can use the tables in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to determine weather, rolling again whenever it seems interesting to do so.

Other tables in that chapter can also be quite useful for determining the chaotic content of an island; the Monuments and Wierd Locales tables are a way to provide ideas for random discoveries, thought he DM can adjust them to fith the story and the theme. Keep in mind that Kythri is home to **mimics** of all sizes; an unusual monument might be a colossal mimic!

The primary denizens of the Shifting Island are monstrosities and beasts that blend the features of multiple creatures. Populations expand and contract, and don't have to be sustainable, so adventurers could find a plateau filled with griffons, or a realm of chimeras where each one has a different arrangement of heads. The intelligent inhabitants of the island are almost entirely slaadi, but they aren't neccessarily hostile. The Slaad Cultures table earlier in the section can give ideas about their motives, and the Random Settlements tables in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* can generate a random slaad community. The Race Relations tables could refer to the different colors of slaadi, or to their relations to intelligent monstrosities or planar travelers; the "racial minority are rulers" result could be a slaad village where adventurers are worshiped as gods!

#### Cornerstone

Cornerstone is the largest of the slaad cities. Its architectural style and precise layout are constantly changing, but it's always a sprawling city that houses hundreds of thousands of slaadi. If Cornerstone is held by the Concordance of Iron, it has vast armies drilling (though their tactics and units constantly shift). If it's under the influence of the Final Regency, there are immense temples and countless shrines to the slaadi interpretation of the Sovereigns. The Random Settlements tables of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* can be useful here to determine specific attributes of the current incarnation.

The attitude of slaadi toward adventurers depends on the active culture. The Final Regency may welcome adventurers who profess devotion to the Sovereigns, provided they don't question the Regency interpretation. The Confluence of Reality celebrates extraplanar visitors, desiring their stories and performances. Meanwhile, the Cornerstone of the Glorious Union of Flesh is a very dangerous place to visit! Regardless, Cornerstone is the best place to acquire Kythrian artifacts or magical services.

#### Zertherun IV

Zertherun IV is one of the monastery vessels of the githzerai. It's under the guidance of the Serene Azera, whose mental discipline maintains the stability of the ship. The Alazerth Elemon is a senior monk charged with dealing with outsiders, which is sometimes a matter of diplomatic negotiations, and other times, rallying zerths to defend the vessel from attack. Like most githzerai, Elemon isn't inherently hostile toward outsiders, but has no great love for them; his reaction is based entirely on the actions and approach of the visitors.

Kythri's Broken Rhythms and The Odds Are Odd properties don't apply in a githzerai monastery, and while Constant Change exists, its effects are minimized. Zertherun IV maintains capacitors for change, such as gardens of small stones and engraved wheels with shifting patterns, which absorb the energies of change and prevent it from transforming the vessel.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are ways that Kythri can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Kythrian manifest zones are often unpredictable in minor ways. Weather patterns may deviate from the surrounding region and change on a moment's notice. The plane's universal properites also carry over to many manifest zones. Any Kythrian zone with the Constant Change property might produce monstrosities. A zone with the Fluid in Form property amplifies the effects of transmutation magic and can have dramatic effects on the success of magebreeding; these zones are extraordinarily valuable to House Vadalis.

Manifest zones can occasionally serve as gateways, allowing creatures from Kythri to slip through into Eberron, intentionally or accidentally. Many monstrosities make their home in the wilds, whereas other creatures--like slaadi--can present vaery unusual encounters, depending what culture they're from.

#### Coterminous and Remote

Kythri's cycle of coterminous and remote periods is completely unpredictable, lasting anywhere from days to centuries. Curiously, its proximity to Eberron has no discernable effects.

#### Kythrian Artifacts

Materials from Kythrian manifest zones are often important components of magic items tied to transmutation or illusion; *shiftweave* uses fibers of plants harvested in Kythrian zones, and as noted in chapter 4, the manifest zone of Hal'kyth is a vital part of the transmutation industry of the Eternal Dominion. Items that come from Kythri may have unpredictable effects. For example, a *hat of disguise* from Kythri may function normally when its wearer keeps in mind exactly what they want to look like; but if they don't consciously enforce an appearance, it slowly but continuously changes minor elements of their disguise.

### Kythrian Stories

Visitors from Kythri can cause excitement, and an accidental journey to a Shifting Island can be an easy source of adventure; can the adventurers find a way back before they are consumed by the Churning Chaos? Here are a few other ideas.

***Vadalis Park.*** The dragonmarked houses are looking for new sources of revenue in the wake of the Last War. Jalan d'Vadalis, a brilliant magebreeder, has created a resort where people can interact with a vast array of intriguing monstrosities, including a few of his own design. This park is built on a Kythrian manifest zone, and Jalan hasn't yet recognized that the Constant Change property is sabotaging his security systems and dangerously mutating his monstrosities. He was so preoccupied with whether he could do it, he didn't stop to think whether he *should*...

***Terror at Sea.*** While at sea, the adventurers pass through a Kythrian manifest zone at exactly the wrong time, and a blue or red slaadi from the Union of Flesh slips aboard the ship. It infects or implants a few passengers, doing its best to hide. Can the adventurers defeat this lurking threat before it's too late? Or will a wave of newborn slaadi take over the ship?

***Superstars.*** A gray slaad reveals its presence to the adventurers. It's from the Confluence of Reality and wants to bring the adventurers to Cornerstone to represent their cultures. What could go wrong? Well, while the Confluence is usually peaceful, *this* time it wants the adventurers to represent their culture in a massive extraplanar gladiatorial match. Can they defeat champions from across Eberron and the other planes? Or is the only hope of survival to flee into the Sea of Chaos and try to find another way home?

***The Hunt.*** The adventurers stumble into a pitched battle: a trio of githzerai ambushed by Transcendent Flesh cultists. Only one survives the battle. This zerth has a psychic connection to the illithid master of the cult cell, and is determined to bring down this mind flayer. Will the adventurers work with the zerth and end this threat? And is this solely about the hunt, or does the githzerai have a hidden agenda?

## Lamannia: The Twilight Forest

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/173%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

Lamannia embodies primordial nature, untapped and untamable. It's often called the Twilight Forest, and is depicted as a realm of colossal trees and massive beasts. However, the forest is just one of the facets of Lamannia. Every natural environment is represented in various layers that exemplify and exaggerate their features. Windswept desert, raging ocean, endless plains--all can be found here. In other planes, these environments are backdrops to the story the realm is telling. In Lamannia, the environment is the story. It doesn't need the help of fey or fiends to make its point, because the land itself is the point.

Some scholars assert that Lamannia served as a blueprint for the Material Plane--that here, the Progenitors perfected the ideas of storm and stone. They believe that the natural world is infused with the essence of Lamannia, and that druids and others who wield primal magic actually manipulate that Lamannian essence. And indeed, druids who travel to the Twilight Forest can be overwhelmed by the sheer force of nature that infuses this place.

Lamannia lies close to the world, and it's one of the easiest planes to reach. Its treasures are natural objects imbued with elemental power--wood, stone, herbs, and plants, all of which are stronger and more potent than their mortal counterparts. But when you come to Lamannia, there are many predators, and you are prey; anyone who seeks to despoil the embodiment of nature will be hunted.

#### Universal Properties

Lamannia is a reflection of the natural world, intensified and exaggerated. The air is pure and clean, the water fresh and clear. Colors are impossibly vivid. It's suffused with life--a realm in which any stone could be an earth elemental, where any tree could be awakened. Vegetation is nearly always in bloom, and beasts are almost always in the peak of health. Except for a few layers such as the Rot, Lamannia reflects the ideal state of the natural world. Here are some of the plane's consistent properties.

***Extended Druidic Magic.*** When a creature casts a druid spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer while in Lamannia, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected. A DM could decide to extend this effect to other characters that draw on primal sources of magic, such as a Gatekeeper ranger or a Greensinger bard.

***Indomitable Beasts.*** Beasts and elementals have a +2 bonus to Constitution and advantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws. Upon its arrival in Lamannia, any elemental or beast that's charmed or bound in any way is immediately freed from that effect; this can be disastrous for an elemental airship that's thrown into the plane.

***Elemental Power.*** When a creature casts a spell that summons or conjures an elemental, it does so as if the spell were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

***The Land Provides.*** A creature has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to forage for food or shelter. In most layers of Lamannia, the vegetation is bountiful and the land sustaining. (While in the Broken Land, it may be very difficult to forage, but you'll at least have advantage to help you with the roll!)

***Primordial Matter.*** It's difficult to destroy or contaminate the matter of Lamannia. All nonmagical food and drink is purified and rendered free of poison and disease. In addition, natural materials such as wood and stone are tougher than their mundane counterparts. When trying to destroy objects made of Lamannian materials, increase the Armor Class suggested in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* by 3, and double the hit points of the object.

***Standard Time.*** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

### Denizens

Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

#### Beasts

Lamannia's primary inhabitants are beasts--both ones that you might encounter in the wilds of Eberron, and massive creatures that can be seen as iconic representations of their type: the idealized incarnation of Bear or Wolf. Any natural creature can be found in Lamannia; indeed, some sages assert that the presence of a creature in Lamannia is what defines it as "natural."

For the most part, Lamannian beasts are no smarter than their counterparts on Eberron. However, some animals possess intelligence similar to that granted by the awaken spell, though even these beasts generally follow their natural instincts and live wild lives. While the giant owls of Sharn may own shops and run for city council, the giant owls of Lamannia are content to hunt the beasts of the Twilight Forest. So it's possible to find creatures in Lamannia that speak Common or a Primordial dialect, but most have little interest in long conversations.

The beasts of Lamannia generally fall into the following four categories.

***Mundane animals.*** are identical to their counterparts in Eberron. Any natural creature can be found in a layer with an appropriate environment. If such beasts are the first things adventurers encounter in a visit to Lamannia, they might not even realize they've traveled to another plane.

***Dire animals.*** are creatures of remarkable size. Such creatures are more common than mundane animals; in the Twilight Forest, most owls are giant owls, and they prey on giant weasels and rats. The *Monster Manual* has a few examples of "dire" and "giant" beasts, but any natural beast could have a dire counterpart in Lamannia.

***Megafauna.*** re gargantuan beasts. The roc is an example of Lamannian megafauna; those found in Eberron have been drawn through manifest zones or slipped between planes during coterminous periods. The DM can create a wide range of megafauna; a pack of gargantuan wolves could hound the adventurers, or they might meet a megafauna serpent that uses the statistics of a purple work--perhaps even a megafauna dinosaur! While these creatures are similar in form to beasts, they are typically classified as monstrosities. Between their vast size and their connection to the plane, they're immune to most effects that target beasts, and you can't charm a roc with a simple *animal friendship* spell.

***Totems.*** are beasts that are beyond the tactical scale--creatures that can be measured in miles. The gnome explorer Tasker tells a tale of an island in the Endless Ocean that turned out to be an enormous turtle; another of his stories features a pack of lycanthropes living in the fur of a massive roaming wolf. Such totems aren't natural creatures and don't need to eat. Their origins and purpose are unsolved mysteries, but most sages believe that they are immortal spirits projected by the plane itself. Some claim that the totems are connected to all creatures cast in their image. Others believe that the totems are sources of primal power, and barbarians, shifters, and druids can receive power and guidance from them. All that's known for sure is that they're immune to common spells, and there are no accounts of anyone successfully harming or communicating with a totem.

#### Elementals

After beasts, the most common inhabitants of the plane are elementals. Unlike the genies, mephits, and anthropomorphic elementals of Fernia and Syrania, Lamannia's elementals are the pure, living essence of the elements, unburdened by any humanoid desire. These include the standard earth, fire, air, and water elementals, but they can come in a wide array of sizes and forms. Adventurers exploring the Broken Lands could encounter tiny globs of lava crawling across the land, while the leviathans of the Endless Ocean and the elder tempests of the First Storm are forces of apocalyptic power.

The Zil gnomes commonly summon and bind the elementals of Lamannia, using them to propel lightning rails and airships. While intelligent, these elementals are utterly alien. They have little concept of time and perceive the world purely through the balance of elements. The sole desire of most elementals is to express their element: to *burn*, to *flow*, to *fly*. Many have an antagonistic attitude toward spirits of other elements, which drives the deadly conflict between them in the Broken Land--this poses an obstacle in dealing with elementals, as they tend to perceive humanoids as globs of water. While it's possible for a character that speaks Primordial to talk with a Lamannian elemental, it's usually difficult to establish any sort of common basis for negotiation. Still, there are legends of wandering druids who "befriended earth and air," so anything is possible!

#### Humanoids

There are merfolk in Eberron--such as the Kalamer of the Thunder Sea--but their people began in the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, and are still found there. These primordial merfolk remain close to their elemental roots and instincts. They wield druidic magic, but don't craft tools or structures. Other humanoid natives of Lamannia are much the same; any race with a strong primal connection could be tied to Lamannia, but they're driven by instinct and avoid the trappings of civilization. There could be tabaxi dwelling in the branches of the Twilight Forest, but if so, they'll seem wild.

Over a century ago, during the Silver Crusade, there were many lycanthropes who fled to Lamannia. As long as they remain on this plane, a lycanthrope can't spread the curse to anyone other than their offspring, and the unnatural impulses of the curse--the drive to prey on innocents, the bloodlust that can cause a victim of lycanthropy to lose control of their actions--are suspended. Meanwhile, primal instincts are amplified; Lamannian werewolves remain predators and take joy in the hunt, but they aren't driven to evil, and remain in full control. Packs and communities of lycanthropes are scattered across the layers. Most are descended from lycanthropes who fled Eberron to escape both the templars and the dark power whose corrupting influence led to the crusade; these shapeshifters embrace their primal nature and rarely assume humanoid forms. But there are also packs descended from afflicted templars who chose exile over death, and who strive to preserve the beliefs and traditions of their ancestors.

A handful of druids and rangers have crossed into Lamannia and chosen to remain in this primal paradise. Many run with lycanthrope packs, embracing their feral instincts and spending their days in wild shape. Others act as planar shepherds, seeking to minimize the impact of dangerous manifest zones and help unwary travelers.

![Artist: Tithi Luadthong](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/175%20tithi%20luadthong.png)

#### Greater Powers?

There are no celestials or fiends in Lamannia. Yet explorers often report a feeling that they are being watched, and there are times when random events seem to be guided by an unseen hand. When outsiders have sought to establish industries in Lamannia, they've been attacked by megafauna or elder elementals, or struck by especially vicious turns of weather. It's possible that this is the work of the totems, and that they have great influence over their layers. Or there could be a greater power that watches over the entire plane. Some scholars assert that the moon Olarune is the consciousness that governs the plane, and Eldeen shifter traditions that predate the practices of the Wardens of the Wood also reflect this belief. Shifter druids suggest that Olarune created the shifters, and the first lycanthropes were her champions.

### Layers

Each of Lamannia's layers highlights a particular aspect of primal nature. One layer in Lamannia might contain a single colossal mountain peak; on the other hand, the Twilight Forest could be as large as Khorvaire (or even Eberron itself). The edge of a layer could be an impassable physical barrier, or it could wrap around onto itself--if you sail far enough in the Endless Ocean, you'll find yourself back where you began. Most layers of Lamannia follow a traditional day-night cycle, though they aren't synchronized across layers, and when the moon Olarune is visible, it's always full.

The portals that connect the layers of Lamannia often only allow travel in one direction. Any deep pool of water may connect a layer to the Endless Ocean; but while you can get to the Ocean by diving into a pond in the Twilight Forest, there's no gate back to the forest on the other side. The Endless Ocean contains small islands, and if you explore one, you'll find you've moved to a new layer.

The following are just a handful of Lamannia's many layers. In creating a layer, think of a distinctive natural feature--a canyon, a desert, a lone mountain--and build the layer around it. What creatures would be found there? Have any outsiders taken up residence? Is there an unusual role for elementals? How does it connect to other layers or Eberron?

#### The Twilight Forest

The sky is hidden by the dense canopy of this vast rainforest, leaving the forest floor in an endless twilight. The trees are over a hundred feet in height--impressive, certainly, though not as tall as the greatpines of the Towering Wood in the Eldeen Reaches. But as people further explore the Twilight Forest, they come upon strange ridges and walls of wood, some forming twisted wooden canyons. Following these, explorers discover they're the roots of unimaginably colossal trees, vast titans wider and taller than the towers of Sharn. The Twilight Forest as mortals experience it lies in the shadow of the grander canopy that rises far above it, and these enormous trees are home to megafauna and mightier beings.

Though the Twilight Forest is wild and untamed, explorers can find wide cleared paths through the lower forest. Survival experts may recognize that these aren't trails created by humanoid hands; rather, they're the paths of totems, who have crushed the lesser forest beneath their colossal feet. The forest is filled with beasts--mundane and dire creatures in the lower forests, megafauna in the grand canopy above it, and the occasional passage of totems. There are multiple communities of lycanthropes scattered throughout the lower forest. A clan of wererats have carved out a warren in the roots of a colossal tree, while a pack of wild wereboars feuds with werewolves descended from exiled templars. An ancient elf druid named Haral, who spends most of her time in the form of an owl, does her best to maintain order; she is assisted in this by a megafauna owl she calls Ruark.

The forest has many other inhabitants, and a few minor elementals can be found in this layer. A gust of wind, a pool of water, a rolling stone--in Lamannia, any of these things could be *alive*.

#### The Broken Land

The Broken Land is a volcanic region filled with high mountains and lava plains. There are constant eruptions, and the layer is home to many fire and earth elementals that engage in an ongoing environmental conflict. Fire elementals flow out with the lava as volcanoes erupt; earth elementals work to contain the eruptions and to rebuild the shattered peaks, only to have them erupt again. Few beasts manage to thrive in this layer, but some tough dinosaurs have clawed out a niche. While this region has fewer connections to Eberron than the Twilight Forest, it's also possible to find remnants of other travelers here; it's a harsh and deadly landscape for stranded adventurers or for those who seek a lost relic from this place.

#### The Endless Ocean

This layer reflects the majesty of the ocean depths. It's home to a vast array of fish and aquatic beasts, along with merfolk tribes and a wide range of water elementals, from simple sentient currents and weirds to massive leviathans and battling megafauna. The Endless Ocean is where the gnome Tasker encountered an island that turned out to be a totem turtle. True islands are few and far between, and most are actually portals to other layers of Lamannia. There are many points in the Endless Ocean tied to manifest zones (most located in ocean depths) in the Material Plane.

#### The First Storm

A layer of plains and low hills, this region is permanently lashed by hurricane winds and endless storms. Beasts huddle in caves and the limited shelter, while all manner of elementals clash in the storm-lashed plains. A massive elder tempest drives the heart of the storm; during the Sundering of Sarlona, an apocalyptic cult in Ohr Kaluun sought to bring this elemental to Eberron, believing it would destroy the world.

#### The Rot

Decay is part of nature, and this is reflected in the swamp-like Rot, a relatively small layer filled with fallen, rotting trees. Corpses of megafauna beasts lie scattered around the layer, and giant insects and other massive scavengers prey on their remains. There's a community of wererats thriving in the Rot, and there could be a small outpost of the Children of Winter who found their way here. While the Rot is a symbol of death and decay, it's entirely natural, and undead have no place here. IT's possible a necromancer could arrive here, hoping to animate the massive corpsese; however, this would violate the theme of the plane, and if there's any higher power at work in Lamannia, it would certianly direct forces to counter this. While most layers of Lamannia are free from disease, disease itself is part of nature; a manifest zone tied to the Rot could spread plagues into the surrounding region.

#### Titan's Folly

Lamannia is filled with precious natural resources; it's hardly surprising that an advanced civilization would try to harvest them. During the Age of Giants, the Group of Eleven set up a research station and mining camp in a layer of Lamannia. After a decade struggling against megafauna attacks and elemental-enhanced weather, the outpost was finally overwhelmed and abandoned. It's a testament to the arcane engineering of the giants that anything remains of this structure... although it may be that it remains because the ruin itself has become a symbol of nature reclaiming civilization. Vines and moss cover shattered walls, and the bones of giants are scattered throughout the remnants of this garrison. Valuable and powerful treasures may well be hidden in the Folly, but explorers will have to contend with aggressive elementals, dangerous beasts, and traps left by the long-dead giants themselves.

### Planar Manifestations

A town is established in the desolate Blade Desert, but it thrives beside a small lake that provides fresh water and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fish. In a small Eldeen village, the locals live in harmony with a breed of giant rabbits unknown elsewhere in Khorvaire. A tribe of shifters lives in the branches of three massive trees that grow in a Lamannian manifest zone. These are all examples of how Lamannia can affect the Material Plane; below are a few more.

#### Manifest Zones

Lamannian manifest zones are relatively common, and usually share one or more of the plane's universal properties. They're often found at the heart of a region that resembles the connected layer; zones tied to the Endless Ocean are found underwater, while manifest zones tied to the Twilight Forest can be found in the Towering Wood, the King's Forest, and other vast woodlands. It's relatively common for these zones to serve as gateways to Lamannia, though they might require a lunar alignment or a coterminous period. This goes in reverse too, as creatures can be pulled through to the Material Plane, from hostile elementals to deadly megafauna.

Zilargo has a number of valuable zones with the Elemental Power property, and House Cannith and the Twelve are eager to find more of these zones--though they're also dangerous, as elementals sometimes spontaneously manifest in such places, linger for a few hours, then dissipate. Bound elementals can also break free from their bonds in some Lamannian manifest zones--especially unfortunate if that elemental is responsible for keeping an airship aloft!

Plants and beasts near Lamannian zones often are significantly larger and healthier than their counterparts in other areas, and many House Vadalis enclaves are built in these zones. Zones with the Primordial Matter property can also be a valuable resource for communities, with purified food and water and the presence of extremely durable wood and other materials for industry. The prison of Dreadhold is built in such a manifest zone.

However, though Lamannian manifest zones can be useful tools for communities and dragonmarked houses, some zones actively resist and repel civilization. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay can combine to quickly destroy structures built in the zone and overgrow the ruins

#### Coterminous and Remote

While Lamannia is coterminous, the effects of Lamannian manifest zones are enhanced. In regions of unspoiled nature--such as the Eldeen Reaches and the wilds of Q'barra--fertility of both plants and animals is enhanced, and beasts conceived in these periods are often exceptionally strong and healthy. Spells that target beasts or elementals are extended; if a spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

While Lamannia is remote, fertility rates drop, and beasts born in these periods are often weak or sickly. Animals are often uneasy, and the duration of spells that affect beasts or elementals are cut in half, to a minimum duration of one round.

Lamannia traditionally becomes coterminous for a week around the summer solstice, and is remote for a week during the winter solstice.

#### Lamannian Artifacts

Lamannian vegetation is prized by alchemists. Herbs and roots from Lamannia can produce exceptionally strong potions, and many types of Lamannian vegetation have innate magical effects; there are bushes in the Twilight Forest that naturally produce *goodberries*. Lamannian lumber likewise can have unusual properties, mirroring the densewood and bronzewood found in Aerenal. Lamannian wood and stone can serve as powerful focuses for primal magic, for creating *figurines of wondrous power*, or for tools designed to summon or bind elementals.

### Lamannian Stories

Lamannia is a source of elementals and dire beasts. It's wild and untamed, strengthening primal magic and providing a haven to lycanthropes. It resists any intrusion by civilization. Here are a few ideas for working it into your story.

***A Savage Land.*** When a party of adventurers unknowingly passes through a Lamannian gateway, they must find a way to survive in this wild realm. This could be as simple as finding another manifest zone to take them home, or it could require them to survive in Lamannia for months while waiting for the planes to become coterminous. Or perhaps their airship passes through a manifest zone and the elemental breaks free; the adventurers are stranded, along with other survivors.

***Megafauna Island.*** An island near a Lamannian manifest zone is discovered to be the home to an unusual array of megafauna beasts. Adventurers could stumble onto this on their own, or they could be hired by an heir of House Vadalis who wants to investigate the rumors without drawing the attention of rivals in the house. Perhaps the adventurers find a legendary megafauna ape--which, if captured, might break free while on exhibition and climb the towers of Sharn!

***At War with Nature.*** An Ashbound druid manages to establish a new Lamannian manifest zone in a major city, such as Fairhaven or Sharn. It's causing the city to crumble, releasing elementals and dense vegetation as the wilderness takes over. Can the adventurers find a way to remove the manifest zone?

## Mabar: The Endless Night

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/177%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

A sea of liquid shadows laps against black sands and basalt cliffs. A skull lies half-buried in the sand, empty sockets gazing into the roiling mist. The bone isn't sun-bleached, for there is no sun here--only a faint glimmer from the smoky gray moon that hangs in the sky.

Early scholars studying reports of Mabar concluded that it was the Plane of Darkness--that this physical property is its defining concept. However, the plane's eternal gloom is just a symptom of its true nature. Even the brightest day eventually ends in darkness, and Mabar embodies this idea. It's the shadow that surrounds every island of light, patiently waiting to consume it. It's entropy, despair, and loss. This isn't the place where the souls of the living go after death, but rather, it's the plane of death itself--the hunger that consumes both light and life.

Mabar is the source of negative energy, and the origin of most undead. Manifest zones--and most undead--tied to Mabar consume the life force from the world around them. However, some people maintain that negative energy itself is just a tool, and that the power of Mabar can be harnessed for good.

#### Universal Properties

The Endless Night consumes life and light. It's a wellspring of necrotic energy, where light is swallowed by gloom, and unprotected creatures quickly die. Mabar has the following universal properties.

***Necrotic Power.*** A creature has disadvantage on saving throws against necromancy spells. An undead creature has 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and advantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.

***Radiant Void.*** In order to cast a spell that deals radiant damage or restores hit points, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.

***Eternal Shadows.*** There is no bright light in Mabar. Any object or effect that would usually create bright light only creates dim light.

***The Hunger of Mabar.*** Mabar consumes the life force of living things. For every minute a living creature spends in Mabar, it takes 10d6 points of necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar, creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage, and creatures under the effects of a *death ward* spell are immune to the effects of this property.

***Standard Time.*** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

#### The Consuming Darkness

The planes don't usually interact with one another. The armies of Shavarath endlessly battle each other; they don't lay siege to Xoriat. Each plane is an isolated, perfect vision of a particular concept. But the concept that defines Mabar is the hunger to consume all light and life, along with the inevitable downfall of all things. When the proper forces align, Mabar pulls fragments of other planes into the Endless Night; over time, these are drained of light and hope and transformed into new layers of Mabar.

Initially, these captured planar fragments become part of the Hinterlands and night falls in the region, but they don't yet have any of Mabar's universal properties. Over time, the fragment's properties from its previous plane are replaced by the properties of Mabar. Once the fragment acquires the last property in this process, the Hunger of Mabar, it's fully assimilated into the Endless Night as a new symbol of entropy and despair. Mortal inhabitants of the fragment are typically transformed into shadows or other forms of undead, while immortals might become yugoloths, or twisted into dark mockeries of their former selves. The conversion is slow and inevitable, and the Dark Powers of Mabar don't have to take any action--but regardless, most enjoy tormenting the fragments. Undead prey on the edges of fragments besieged by the Bone King, and yugoloth soldiers raid fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows.

As an example of a converted fragment, consider the Drifting Citadel. This floating tower was once a library in Syrania. Now it drifts through an icy void, grand windows shattered and books fallen from their shelves. Shadows of sages clutch at books with insubstantial fingers, never able to turn a page. The angelic librarians have become tormented spirits who hunger for knowledge, draining the memories from any creature unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp.

At times, the great powers of other planes have tried to stop Mabar from capturing fragments of other planes--but to no avail. The darkness can't be stopped, as it's part of the machinery of reality--the Endless Night consumes and fragments are lost. Those pulled into the darkness can fight against it, but the ultimate outcome is inevitable. Were it not for Irian, Mabar would eventually consume everything. But as the Night consumes, the Dawn restores, and so balance is ultimately maintained.

The process of consumption is slow and ongoing, and there are always multiple fragments in the Hinterlands. It may take Mabar months, years, or even centuries to consume a fragment. As the properties are replaced, the landscape of the fragment changes to reflect it. In a former fragment of Lamannia, the vegetation around the borders begins to wilt. Creatures become sickly, and totems may not be seen at all, or they might be terrifying shadows, killing the grass they walk on.

Mabar typically targets other planes, but it can claim pieces of the Material Plane as well. This initial effect is reminiscent of the Mourning; gray fog rolls over the region that's affected, and all that's caught within the fog is lost. However, Mabar typically claims a region the size of a town, or perhaps a county; it's never been known to claim an entire country. Typically the fog fades within a day, leaving a barren region stripped of vegetation and structures. Mabar's power is such that it also consumes the memories of the place; most mortals simply forget that the affected region ever was anything but barren, and forget the people consumed in the process. This process isn't perfect or absolute, but when contradictory information is presented, people instinctively try to rationalize it. Maybe they heard a story about the lost town? The uncle who lived in that town? Didn't he die in the war? In short, player characters might realize something is wrong, but be unable to convince others of it. Because of this magical effect and the fact that it happens so rarely, the common people of Khorvaire don't know about this aspect of Mabar. But if a group of strong-willed player characters investigates it, they might be able to discover the cause of lost colonies and other mysteries.

### Denizens

From shadows of mortal souls to Mabar's Dark Powers, the Endless Night's inhabitants all embody aspects of darkness, despair, and death. The plane's denizens fall into these five general categories.

#### Shadows

Shadows are the most numerous inhabitants of Mabar. These semi-sentient spirits linger in places where you might expect to find people, forlornly pantomiming the roles of the absent inhabitants. You'll find the shadows of children playing on the corner of a Mabaran street, and the shadow of a priest silently praying to an absent and unknown god in a shattered temple. In his Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran asserts that every mortal has a shadow in Mabar, much like the conscripts of Shavarath; this theory is supported by the shadow-gardeners of the Amaranthine City. However, the shadows of Mabar don't speak, and they're driven by impulse and instinct; if they're tied to living creatures, they're just a dark sliver of each soul. The shadows hunger for the lifeforce of mortals, but they ignore creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage or that are shielded by the *death ward* spell.

Most Mabaran shadows use the statistics for **shadows** from the *Monster Manual*, though especially strong shadows could be represented by **wraiths** or **specters**.

#### Yugoloths and Other Immortals

The immortals of Mabar are spirits of darkness. The yugoloths--embodiments of hunger, despair, and death--are the citizens of a vast empire centered on the Amaranthine City, most serving as soldiers. In the Hinterlands, yugoloths battle celestials and fiends trapped in these doomed fragments, until the fragments are ultimately fully drained, assimilated, and their immortal inhabitants converted to a form more suited to the Endless Night. It's questionable if these battles actually speed up the assimilation, or if they're simply a way for the yugoloths to pass the time. If there are no immortals to battle, the yugoloths simply spread despair; an oinoloth may spread plague through a fragment of the Material Plane, then spend a year watching the result.

Some yugoloths are gardeners, but what they cultivate are shadows. By shaping a mortal's shadow, a fiend can fill that mortal with despair or drive them down dark paths. When the associated mortal eventually dies, the yugoloth can refine that shadow into quintessence; this substance is crafted by yugoloth artists and artisans into tools and weapons that can cause death and despair, should they make their way to the mortal world. While most gardeners work with shadows, some go into the fragments of the Hinterlands to directly torment the hostages in slow and subtle ways. Other yugoloths are philosophers and oracles who contemplate the nature of entropy and the way in which all things will end. And some serve menial roles in the Amaranthine City.

The yugoloths make up the majority of the immortals of Mabar, but there are others. Mabaran incubi and succubi embody emotional pain and loss. Some prey on hostages in fragments, while others live alongside the yugoloths and ply their wiles on them; the suffering of a fiend is just as satisfying to them as that of a mortal. Other incubi and succubi are gardeners, and some believe that these can drain the love from a mortal heart by bleeding it from their shadow. There are also immortals from other fragments that have been transformed--angels and devils reshaped by the Endless Night.

#### Undead

Mabar is the origin of most undead. Sentient undead are created when a dying creature's soul is bound to Mabar instead of passing to Dolurrh. The energy of Mabar sustains the creature--be it wraith, mummy, or vampire--while the creature serves as a conduit to the Endless Night. This is why many undead directly consume the life force of other creatures. Even those who don't do so directly may drain life from the world simply by existing; this is why plants are often withered in areas frequented by the undead. Likewise, this connection to Mabar has a corrupting effect that pulls most intelligent undead toward evil alignments. Even people who were good in life find that Mabar erodes their empathy and compassion; it's a struggle to maintain your humanity when your existence is bound to the Endless Night.

There are also many undead in Mabar itself. Many of these are merely symbolic manifestations of Mabar, not actually the remains of mortal beings; the endless skeletal armies of the Bone King are manifestations and the Bone King himself was likely never mortal. Specters and wraiths are especially powerful shadows; some are the work of gardeners, while others emerge from the pure darkness of Mabar. The more desolate planes, like the Obsidian Desert, are ruled by nightwalkers, powerful conduits of negative energy; they often attack fragments, feeding on the energy of the fragment and accelerating its assimilation.

Beyond this, the souls of sentient undead are bound to Mabar. When a vampire, mummy, lich, or similar creature is physically destroyed, it doesn't get the release of Dolurrh; instead, the soul becomes a wraith in Mabar, forever driven by the hunger of the Endless Night. Most are driven mad by this process, but perhaps the adventurers might once again encounter a vampire they previously killed, now a spectral lord in the Endless Night.

#### The Dark Powers

The mightiest and most malevolent beings in Mabar are known as the Dark Powers. Each embodies a particular aspect of Mabar and rules a domain of linked layers. Some have been part of Mabar since the beginning of time, while others have risen from the fragments consumed by the Endless Night. Most of the Dark Powers are equivalent in power to archfey or archfiends, though they're even stronger in the layer they're bound to, their seat of power. However, they have a limited ability to act beyond Mabar, and can only affect the Material Plane through warlocks or undead servants. Three of the Dark Powers that are known on Eberron are described later in this section, but there are many more in the shadows.

#### Hostages

The fragments in the Hinterlands hold all the creatures that dwelled in each before they were captured. When a mortal dies there, they return as a shadow or undead. Immortals are bound to their fragment; they can't leave it, and if they die, they're reborn there. So creatures from any plane could be found here, including the Material Plane. A chunk of Risia might hold frost giants. A fragment of the Endless Ocean might have a pod of merfolk. But the longer they remain in Mabar, the more the plane corrupts the fragment and the creatures in it, until they become shadows, undead, or something worse. A mortal creature that lives through this process may have all the light drained from its soul or be consumed by despair. While it might retain its original appearance, it should be considered an aberration; in the end, it will seek to spread misery and extinguish both light and life.

### Layers

It's always night in Mabar, and its shadowy moon, Sypheros, remains fixed in the sky. While the setting varies across its countless layers--a desert, a ruined city, the withered remains of fertile farmland--the story is always about loss, entropy, despair, and death. A layer might contain a massive battlefield filled with the intertwined bones of dragons and giants. Ossuaries and catacombs. Crumbling memorials, with names too faded to read. Barren orchards and dried riverbeds. And tombs, from tiny unmarked crypts to the death-palaces of fallen rulers, necropolises filled with traps and treasures. And this being the Endless Night, some of those dead rulers still dominate their domains, whether they take the form of undead or simply malevolent will.

Layers are linked in domains, and each one is bound to one of the Dark Powers. The denizens of the layers and the overall themes reflect the influence of that Dark Power, so layers in the Kingdom of Bones are largely inhabited by undead, while yugoloths dwell in layers bound to the Amaranthine City. Some layers are bounded by physical barriers, but most either loop back on themselves or end in walls of fog--not unlike the dead-gray mists of the Mournland--and any who wander into the mists reemerge elsewhere in the layer. Within domains, layers are often connected by physical portals--perhaps a massive gate or a pool of shadows. Moving between domains requires plane shift or performing a ritual tied to that domain. These rituals need not be magical; they're simply secrets that have to be learned. If you're in the Kingdom of Bones and you want to get to the domain of the Queen of All Tears, the answer is simple: All you have to do is sincerely cry, and your tears will take you there.

Here are three examples of Mabar's domains, each of which could hold many layers..

#### The Amaranthine City

The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Mabar. Experienced planar travelers may find it familiar, for it's a dark reflection of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Irian shows the city in its first days of glory: prosperous, clean, full of joy and life. The Amaranthine City of Mabar is a haunted shadow of this glory. Like its counterpart, this immense metropolis fills an entire layer, but here, its banners are faded and torn, walls are cracked, and fountains are dry. Shadows still move through the streets, a miserable reminder of the crowds that once filled the city. The rotting tapestries and chipped mosaics speak of a past age of wonders and glory. The two are unmistakably the same city, both in architectural style and the layout of its streets. This feels like the last days of a grand empire, an image of decaying grandeur; but there's great power beneath the tragic façade. The walls may be cracked, but they are still mighty, and the mezzoloth's rusty trident can kill you as easily as a polished one.

The city's ruler, the Empress of Shadows, is the first and greatest of the Dark Powers. Her defining principle is hunger, the desire to consume all that is light, to expand her empire across eternity. She prefers an elegant fiendish form, with polished horns and chitin plates engraved with arcane sigils, but she can take the shape of any yugoloth. She spends much of her time presiding over the decaying pomp and grandeur of the Amaranthine City, but also closely monitors the campaigns in the Hinterlands and occasionally takes time to torment her hostages. The sages of Syrania believe that the Empress of Shadows chooses which fragments of other planes will be pulled into Mabar, and planar emissaries sometimes dwell in the Amaranthine City seeking to negotiate with her.

This city is the seat of the yugoloths; for every yugoloth in the Amaranthine City of Mabar, there is an angel in the city in Irian, all the way up to the Dawn Empress and the Empress of Shadows. Most likely, this is just a way of reflecting the planes' core concepts--beginnings and endings, hope and despair. But it's possible that Irian and Mabar are somehow the same--perhaps the Dawn Empress is the Empress of Shadows, and though they appear to exist at the same time, they reflect the beginning and end of the same spirit.

The layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of imperial ambition and decaying power. Some embody desperation--a collapsing fortress awaiting an assault that will surely destroy it, or an abandoned sanitarium whose inmates are trapped and starving. These regions are inhabited by shadows, but the fiendish gardeners can instill near-sentience into them if it serves their purposes. Fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows are drawn into her empire, and usually acquire a yugoloth outpost even as the life is drained from the region.

#### The Kingdom of Bones

Where the domain of the Amaranthine City feels like an empire in its last days, the Kingdom of Bones is one that's already fallen. If a layer contains a fortress, it's not preparing for a final battle; it's what remained after the battle. The gates are shattered, and bloodstains and broken weapons are scattered across the floors. The people of this domain fought a dreadful war and lost... but this being Mabar, their bones remain. The skeletons of peasants continue their menial labors, seemingly oblivious to the futility of their actions. Even in death, these commoners are oppressed by their cruel lords. Wights, deathlocks, and vampire spawn might serve as the soldiers of the tyrants, while the overlords themselves may be vampires or mummy lords, still ruling from their ruined keeps.

All of the kingdom's cursed nobles bow before the Bone King, who embodies the concepts of death and decay. A lich in rotting finery, he stands as a warning that even the mightiest lords eventually become dust and bone. He prefers to drain the life slowly from fragments he claims; he wants his hostages to dwell on their coming death while their land withers around them, for lords to turn on their people before he finally kills them all.

The Bone King's statistics could be represented using Orcus as a foundation. He can serve as an Undying patron for warlocks, and is known to teach mortal wizards the foul rituals that allow ascension to lichdom. To all who serve him in this way, he grants titles in his kingdom--and the knowledge that when they die, they'll be forever bound to serve in it. He makes few demands of these servants; they feed him whenever they use the powers he grants to slay the living. But a warlock may be tasked to destroy a lich or vampire--or even another warlock--because the Bone King desires them to serve in his kingdom.

#### The Last Desert

A desert of black sand under a starless sky--this is one of Mabar's iconic images. In the Last Desert, there are remnants of glorious monuments: the half-buried head of a grand statue, its eye cracked; a fragment of a memorial wall, engraved with names that can no longer be read; ruins so worn that it's impossible to guess what purpose the building once served. Characters proficient in History and Arcana can recognize that these monuments are drawn from dramatically different cultures; some are the work of celestials, while others might have been created by the giants of Xen'drik.

At the center lies a massive tomb-palace. Its style suggests the architecture of Aerenal, but it's grander than even the City of the Dead. This is the fortress of the Queen of All Tears, the Dark Power of this domain. The Queen is an embodiment of misery, and her subjects are largely incorporeal undead, shadows and wraiths from the barren sand. Meanwhile, cruel specters and banshees attend the Queen, along with succubi and incubi who bask in the delicious misery that suffuses the region. The Queen herself takes the form of a mummified corpse, enshrouded by a spectral image of a beautiful elf woman. The suffering of others is her mead, and her only pleasure is the slow torment of the hostages in her Hinterland fragments.

The Queen of All Tears is one of the youngest of the Dark Powers. She was once a mortal who dreamed of mastering life and death, but her pursuit of these goals resulted in the deaths of everyone she ever loved and everyone who shared her blood. Her kingdom was razed, and she killed her own daughter and transformed her into a lich, so at least one piece of her legacy might survive. Her name was Minara Vol, and she was the mother of Erandis Vol. In the process of becoming a Dark Power, she's lost much of her own identity and sense of her past. She despises both elves and dragons, but has forgotten even her own daughter. If the Queen were to somehow regain her memories, she might seek to strike at the Undying Court and Argonnessen, or to aid Erandis--or it may be that she continues to dwell in her despair and ignore her past.

The Queen's layers are largely desolate and miserable, filled with wailing wraiths and banshees. One is a battlefield plucked from Aerenal, where the bones of elves and dragons lie intertwined; this may hold the key to discovering her past.

#### The Hinterlands

The Hinterlands are the outer edge of Mabar, the collection of planar fragments that are currently being consumed and integrated into the Endless Night. Here, the Hunger of Mabar property has not yet taken hold, which generally makes them safer to visit than other layers of Mabar. The Mabaran properties a fragment reflects vary depending on its nature and how close it is to complete integration with Mabar.

There can be infinite variety in the fragments within the Hinterlands. This largely depends on what plane a fragment is from. Is it a verdant forest of Lamannia? A floating tower of Syrania? Or is it a piece of the Material Plane--a fortress plucked out of the Last War or a Riedran village? The second question is how long the fragment has been under siege. To what degree does it retain its original flavor, and how much has the influence of Mabar oventaken it? The final question is which of the Dark Powers has claimed it--and why? What is it about this region that draws it towards a Dark Power's domain? The Empress of Shadows looks for places that shine too brightly--places that bask in their achievements, sure their glory will never fade. The Bone King claims fragments where commoners suffer or where rulers turn to tyranny; there are a few Karrnathi fragments in his domain, though it can be hard to tell how close they are to being subsumed. The Queen of All Tears seeks the places where terrible tragedies have occurred, forcing the inhabitants to forever dwell in these moments of misery. With fragments of the outer planes, it's more a question of reshaping the plance to fit these stories. By contrast, when it comes to the Material Plane, it's the story itself that often draws the dire hand of Mabar.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few ways Mabar can influence the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Mabaran manifest zones are infamous and almost universally shunned, for nearly all are harmful to the flora and fauna of the region. In some zones, life withers and dies. In others, it's twisted in strange ways; plants may seek the blood of living creatures, or grow unnaturally pale and cold. Rot and decay are often accelerated, and disease can thrive. However, such regions are also often powerful sources of negative energy. Mabaran zones often possess the Necrotic Power universal property, and there are epic rituals and eldritch machines that require a Mabaran manifest zone. The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. *In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy*, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns--which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.

While Mabaran manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, they are powerful sources of negative energy and produce undead. Skeletons, zombies, and ghouls can all spontaneously rise in Mabaran manifest zones, and more powerful undead can be created under the proper circumstances.

#### Coterminous and Remote

On nights when Mabar is coterminous, the Necrotic Power property encompasses the entire world, and the radius of all light sources are halved. During these periods, regions of deepest darkness can serve as gateways to Mabar, releasing shadows or other foul things into the world. This primarily occurs in regions that are suffused with despair or misery, and only at night, ending as soon as dawn breaks. As a result, during coterminous periods, friends and family usually huddle together indoors, keeping the lights burning and telling cheerful tales.

When Mabar is remote, all creatures have resistance to necrotic damage, and undead have disadvantage on saving throws against being turned or frightened.

Traditionally, Mabar is coterminous for three nights in the month of Vult--the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice. The people of the Five Nations call this time Long Shadows. Mabar is remote less frequently, for a period of five days around the summer solstice, but only once every five years.

#### Mabaran Artifacts

Mabaran artifacts are formed from quintessence, the solidified energy of Mabaran shadows. This matte black substance can be used in a similar way to wood, metal, or cloth. Quintessence items are powerful conduits for necromancy and necrotic energy; a *staff of withering*, *sword of wounding*, or *sword of life stealing* might be made from Mabaran quintessence. Items that create undead or consume light might also be crafted from quintessence; such items drain joy and empathy from those that carry them, and those who wield such items often become cold and cruel. Yugoloth artisans can create unique items with even greater powers, but the purpose of these tools is to spread despair and misery. Some drain Hit Dice from their wielders to pay for their deadly abilities; others cause the bearer to rise as an undead creature after death.

The most powerful Mabaran artifacts are battleloths--yugoloths that have allowed themselves to be forged into objects to spread death and despair. These are intelligent and powerful, but drive their wielders down dark paths.

When plants do grow in Mabaran manifest zones, they're often poisonous; bloodvine can produce a variety of deadly venoms. However, the elves of the Bloodsail Principality have mastered the art of gardening in Mabaran zones, and there, you can find wondrous plants that feed on shadows instead of sunlight--darkwood trees, ebon sedge grass, and more. Here, they produce spices and wines unlike any others in the world.

### Mabaran Stories

Mabar inspires cruelty and despair. Its necrotic energies can be a general environmental threat or harnessed as a weapon by warlocks or necromancers. Here are some stories you might explore about this plane.

***Fragmented Mourning.*** It's unlikely that the Mourning was caused by Mabar. The effect is much larger than any fragment, the lingering strangeness doesn't resemble Mabar, and people know it's been destroyed, unlike with most fragments. However, it's entirely possible that part of Cyre could have been claimed by Mabar as the Mourning unfolded--perhaps Metrol still exists in the Hinterlands of Mabar! If so, is there any chance it could be saved? Is Queen Dannel alive? Or could she have somehow been responsible, sacrificing her own people to become one of the Dark Powers herself?

***Shadow on the Moor.*** While passing across a moor, the adventurers are set upon by the shadows of wolves and hawks. The following dawn, they discover that one of the characters is missing their shadow; it's been lost in the manifest zone. Do they need to go back and find it? If so, how? If not, what does it mean that this character no longer has a shadow?

***The Master of Shadholt.*** A cruel warlock holds a small village in his grip. When the adventurers defeat the villain, they make an unpleasant discovery: the village of Shadholt is in a Mabaran manifest zone, and while the warlock was a villain, his rituals also prevented the zone from spreading plagues throughout the entire region. Can the adventurers help one of the villagers take the warlock's place, forging the pact and gaining the powers needed to contain the threat? What Dark Power must they deal with?

***The Drifting Citadel.*** The adventurers are contacted by Itheriel, a scholar-angel of Syrania. The celestial seeks to recover a tome of knowledge from a library tower that was consumed by Mabar. If Itheriel goes to Mabar, they'll be trapped there for eternity; they need the adventurers to recover the book. What isn't Itheriel telling them about the book? Could this celestial relic have become the *Book of Vile Darkness*? What else can be found in the drifting tower?

## Risia: The Plane of Ice

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/182%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

Risia is known as the Plain of Ice, for that's the vast majority of what's found within it. Risia is defined by endless arctic wastes, and what appear to be mountains are just peaks of solid ice. But like Fernia, Risia's appearance can be deceiving. Because it's filled with glaciers and snow, many sages assume that this is its defining principle. But in Lamannia, there are also endless blizzards and majestic glaciers--ice in its natural state. By comparison, the core ideas that define Risia are isolation, stagnation, and preservation. The endless frozen plane isn't about snow, it's about the utter stillness, the empty and unchanging landscape. Risia is sparsely populated, because that's the point of it; it's bleak and lonely, a realm in which you could walk for days and never see another creature. Where a desert of sand can at least shift in the breeze, the frozen landscape of Risia is unchanging. Yet, unlike a stone plateau, it reflects a substance that could change at one point--but is now caught, frozen, stagnant.

Though this isolated and unchanging plane might not seem appealing to adventurers, it's important to remember that the plane represents preservation--and ancient secrets forgotten for ages could be frozen within the ice. And while the realm itself is barren, it's not completely deserted; over millennia, hardy creatures have come to Risia and settled in this desolate realm.

#### Universal Properties

Risia is bitterly cold, and unprotected creatures quickly succumb to the deadly temperatures. Here are a few of the consistent properties of the plane.

***Lethal Cold.*** A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 10 minutes or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that's usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.

***Empowered Ice.*** When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals cold damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.

***Preservation.*** A creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn, entering a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, it's drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn't grow older.

***Stagnation.*** When a creature finishes a long rest, it doesn't regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. However, it does recover Hit Dice normally and can spend them to regain hit points.

***Stillness of Flesh.*** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature's body, and creatures don't age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points, and don't immediately kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property's effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.

### Denizens

Risia's few natives are rarely seen. The concept of the plane is bleak isolation, and an active population would defeat this purpose. A few layers hold creatures that have crossed into Risia from Eberron, ones that can thrive in arctic conditions; there are remorhazes hunting in the Frozen Sea and yetis in the Frostmantle. But these things come and go. The two primary forces in Risia are the native spirits of the plane and the frost giants that have carved out a home in the ice.

#### Spirits of Ice

At first glance, Risia appears to be barren and empty. But some travelers have described a presence, a sense of being watched, and most feel this presence is malign. On the surface, the concept of Risia seems entirely neutral; there's nothing inherently evil about ice. But there's a hunger to Risia--an innate desire to consume warmth and to bury living things in ice. In the *Planar Codex*, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran calls this force the Killing Cold. This greatest power of the plane of isolation is uninterested in being known, and has never interacted directly with outsiders, but its presence can be felt through its manifestations. These include bheur hags, frost salamanders, ice devils, chain devils, and the Lonely (sorrowsworn). The appearance and nature of manifestations reflect the themes of Risia--a chain devil might be shrouded by frost-mist and can bind its enemies with chains of ice. Regardless of their form, these spirits don't speak with outsiders. Their intelligence reflects the cunning with which they stalk their prey, but they are spirits of the Killing Cold, of bitter isolation, and of the ice that entombs and preserves.

When these manifestations aren't active, they're absorbed into their layer; they manifest when they're needed, in the form that's needed. And in the meantime, as spirits of stagnation and isolation, they're perfectly content to sit in silence for centuries before something compels them back into physical form.

#### Frost Giants and Dwarves

The Group of Eleven was an alliance of empyreans of tremendous skill and power. Each studied a different plane (leaving Fernia to the Sulat League and Dal Quor to the Cul'sir). The archarcanist Il'Ara was devoted to Risia, and she magebred her own lineage of frost giants over millennia. When the forces of Argonnessen began to lay waste to Xen'drik, Il'Ara gathered her faithful children and passed through to Risia, certain that they could find sanctuary in the isolation of the Plain of Ice.

Il'Ara's children have since established themselves across the layers of Risia. There are a few citadels where multiple giants live together, while others have established their own solitary outposts. Each has found a different path to surviving the endless tedium of immortality in the icy wastes. Some have become artists, writing poetry or sculpting massive works of art that take centuries to complete. Others pursue physical diversions such as wrestling, hunting fiends, or crafting ornate games. These denizens always take great interest in outsiders as a source of diversion. The crueler giants take joy in hunting newcomers, but others can be excellent hosts. Many artists yearn for an audience--though a genteel giant artist can be deadly if guests don't show proper appreciation for their work. As these Risian frost giants are remnants of the grand civilization of Xen'drik, the DM may wish to increase their intelligence and abilities as suits the story.

Il'Ara continues her arcane studies in her fortress, Winter. She may have found ways to wield vast power over Risia and to protect her children from the fiends... or she could be bored of her immortal existence, considering entering the ice and embracing stasis.

The frost giants of Risia have dwarf servants. Their origin is a mystery: the giants know that Il'Ara produced these first dwarves, but they don't know--or at least remember--if she created them herself or pulled them through from Eberron. These dwarves know no other existence than their servitude to their giant masters, and Risia holds few other options for them. Mysteriously, these dwarves--and all dwarves--are immune to the Stillness of Fleshproperty of Risia. They age just as they would on Eberron, and unlike other mortals on this plane, they can give birth to children who grow and mature. So every giant in Risia came from Xen'drik, and as they die, no new giants replace them; but the dwarves that dwell in Risia were born there, and know nothing of the ancient past.

### Layers

The layers of Risia are few in number but vast in size, connected by great archways of ice. Sometimes, travelers find pools of ice that show images from other layers; breaking through this ice sometimes allows passage, while other times, the images are simply lost. While depictions of Risia often show it with terrifying storms, these are only found in the Boundless Blizzard; most of Risia is utterly still, silent, and deadly. Risia's spirit manifestations can be found in all of these layers. The giants are concentrated in Frostmantle, but outliers can be found in other layers.

The most noteworthy layers are discussed below, but others exist as well. One is a vast, featureless glacier, which may be the inspiration for the title "The Plain of Ice." A small layer holds immense ice sculptures of unknown humanoids; this could be a reflection of primal beings, or perhaps the work of a frost giant artisan who's been sculpting for thousands of years. Another plane contains a series of rivers flowing over an icy plain, but they aren't natural water; the liquid is so cold it shatters any mundane material placed within it.

#### Frostmantle

This seemingly endless range of mountains, formed of solid ice, is surrounded by a sea of dense mist. Perhaps land lies somewhere far below, or the mountains might continue down indefinitely into the darkness. Frostmantle is the primary home of the frost giants of Il'Ara, who have carved citadels from the ice of the mountains. The three largest fortresses are called Freehearth, Remorse, and Winter. Remorse holds many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom, while Winter is the abode of Il'Ara herself. Numerous smaller keeps are spread across the peaks, the abodes of individual giants.

Clouds hide the sky above Frostmantle, but the light is steady and unchanging; night never falls here. Travelers must deal with the effects of high altitude as well as the lethal cold

#### The Boundless Blizzard

Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. Explorers may find themselves on an icy plateau or in a mountain pass; with the vicious storm, visibility is limited to 60 feet, so there's no knowing what lies ahead. Adventurers may find an occasional cave or other shelter, but it's always possible that it's already occupied by a remorhaz or other stranded monstrosity. As this is one of the more dangerous layers, this is a good place to search for the frozen bodies of other adventurers, held in stasis beneath the ice.

The raging storm of the Boundless Blizzard never ends, and adventurers face high winds and lethal cold. The layer is permanently caught between night and day; due to the storm, the light is dim at best, and areas of intense snow may be heavily obscured.

#### The Frozen Sea

magine an ocean frozen in a single instant. There's no sign of any shore, just waves caught mid-crest alongside the frozen funnels of maelstroms. And scattered across the realm, there are countless ships--vessels pulled from the oceans of Eberron in moments when the moons were right and Risia was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked, caught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are in perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice. Ships from throughout history can be found here, Lyrandar elemental galleons alongside massive ships built by the ancient giants of Xen'drik. There could be age-old survivors here, sheltering in their trapped vessels, or a frost giant might have raised a tower of ice above the frozen water. But the spirits are strong here as well, preying on survivors and pulling them down into the frozen depths.

It's always night on the Frozen Sea; the moon Dravago is fixed in the cloudless sky, shedding dim light on the water.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few of the ways Risia can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones to Risia are often found in cold or arctic regions, where their impact isn't immediately obvious. In warmer climes, most manifest zones tied to Risia create regions of unnatural cold, often taking on the plane's Lethal Cold and Empowered Ice properties of the plane, regardless of the regional climate.

In a few Risian zones, the effects of Stillness of Flesh can be felt, slowing or completely stopping the aging, growth, and reproduction of all creatures--except for dwarves, that is. While a manifest zone that prevents aging could be otherwise considered quite a boon, these zones can be quite small, and often tied to deadly cold that makes it difficult to live there.

It's unusual for a Risian zone to transport people to Risia, but it can happen when the planes are coterminous.

#### Coterminous and Remote

While Risia is coterminous, temperatures drop sharply, and areas that would normally be chilly but otherwise safe can take on the Lethal Cold, Empowered Ice, and Stillness of Flesh universal properties. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense cold can be unexpectedly transported to Risia. However, this effect is unpredictable; while it can happen if it serves the story, it's not something most people are afraid of.

When Risia is remote, intense cold loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made against the effects of extreme cold and on saving throws against spells that deal cold damage.

Traditionally, Risia becomes coterminous once every five years for the full month of Zarantyr. Once every five years, exactly two and a half years after it is coterminous, it's remote during the month of Lharvion. However, this isn't always the case. Historians have recorded times when the cycle has extended far longer; in 657 YK, Risia entered a coterminous phase that lasted for three years.

#### Risian Artifacts

Risian ice is vivid blue and charged with the essence of the plane. This ice maintains its temperature under any conditions and never melts, even on the Material Plane. An object carved from Risian ice can be used as a spellcasting focus for spells related to ice or water, and it's a powerful component for creating magical effects related to cold or stasis. While it can develop in both manifest zones and on the plane itself, Risian ice is relatively rare even within Risia; you can't just find giant sheets of it spread across Frostmantle.

The frost giants possess magic items and artifacts that they brought with them from Xen'drik, and Il'Ara has surely created new wonders over the years. Adventurers could also find treasures from any civilization there, either buried in the Frozen Sea or still clutched in the hands of people entombed within the ice.

### Risian Stories

Risia is barren, isolated, and unwelcoming; it's not a place that wants adventurers. Nonetheless, there are many ways it could affect a story.

***Frozen History.*** Il'Ara and her giants possess wondrous relics whose like haven't been seen in Eberron since the Age of Giants. They're a living link to the elven uprising; a giant might have personally fought a Tairnadal elf's ancestor, and it could possess a trophy taken from them. If the adventurers need information or an object from the Age of Giants, they might find it here. The adventurers could seek a ritual found only in Il'Ara's colossal spellbook, or perhaps the empyrean has kept a collection of prisoners from the Age of Giants preserved in Risian ice; this could be a way to meet a Qabalrin elf or one of the first drow!

***Buried Treasures.*** In searching for a vital artifact, the adventurers might learn it's on a ship trapped in the Frozen Sea. The trail of a lost explorer could lead to the Boundless Blizzard. While adventurers could recover valuable treasures from the ice, it's also possible to recover people from it. A legendary hero--or infamous villain--could have been trapped in Risia for centuries. What would happen if adventurers discovered the pirate queen Lhazaar in an icy stasis on her ship in the Frozen Sea?

***Dwarves.*** What's the origin of the dwarves of Risia? Did the empyrean Il'Ara truly create the dwarves, or did she steal them from the Frostfell? Could dwarf adventurers free their distant cousins from the domination of the giants?

***The Killing Cold.*** What is the sinister presence that drives the spirits of ice? No mortal has ever interacted directly with the Killing Cold. When the adventurers are caught in the Boundless Blizzard, they are stalked by deadly manifestations of the Cold. Can they find some way to communicate with these spirits--or the power that drives them?

## Shavarath: The Eternal Battleground

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/185%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

In Shavarath, angels and devils are locked in endless conflict. Radiant blades spill burning blood, and bolts of force smash angels from the sky. In another layer, champions of justice ride armored dragons, assaulting a titanic airship. In yet another, steel krakens tear apart celestial frigates. There's only one constant in Shavarath: war.

The war in Shavarath began at the moment of creation, and it will continue to the end of time. Its primary combatants are immortal, and fallen soldiers return within a day or so. The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, "Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something--anything--else?" In particular, it's common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, "Why don't you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!"

The angel isn't fighting for a single nation, and this war isn't driven by gold or politics. The immortals of Shavarathbelieve that their war is reflected across every reality. Justice. Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory--every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram--strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.

So to an angel, the destruction of a human city--or an entire nation--is trivial. Mortals will die; that's their most defining trait. Even a sympathetic angel sees a mortal as a snowflake: unique, beautiful, but gone in a moment (and sooner if you touch it). The angels fought long before today's mortal civilizations existed, and if they hadn't held this line for countless eons, the Material Plane would be overrun by chaos and cruelty.

If you're a hero, you might look to the angel and say, "What can I do to help? Can we fight at your side?" To which the angel simply smiles and responds, "You already are." Just as every mortal dreams in Dal Quor and has a shadow in Mabar, there's a sliver of every mortal soul that fights in Shavarath. The skill and power of these conscripts reflect your own courage and will... and just like the angels, this sliver of yours can survive a thousand deaths. So it's not your place to fight on the battlefields of Shavarath. You do your part by living your life, by fighting for the principles you believe in wherever you may be.

There is war in Shavarath, and there will always be war in Shavarath. It can't be won, and it can't be abandoned. As a mortal in Shavarath, your primary goal should always be to survive--because in Shavarath, there are a million ways to die.

#### Universal Properties

There's a part of you that's always been in Shavarath, a sliver of your soul that's always been at war. When you're in Shavarath, those instincts guide you. It's easier to strike a deadly blow, or to grit your teeth and fight on through pain or injury.

***War Magic.*** When a creature casts a spell that grants a bonus to AC, attack rolls, or saving throws, or a spell that grants temporary hit points, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

***Unquenchable Fury.*** A creature has advantage on saving throws against any spells or abilities that charm a target, as well as against the calm emotions and sanctuary spells. In addition, the duration of these effects are halved, to a minimum duration of 1 round. While a barbarian is raging, its rage can't be ended early unless it's knocked unconscious.

***Fight On.*** On a creature's turn, it can use a bonus action to spend 1 Hit Die. It rolls the die and adds its Constitution modifier, regaining hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). Once a creature benefits from this property, it must finish a short or long rest before it can do so again.

***Bloodletting.*** When a creature scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, it can roll one of the attack's damage dice one extra time and add it to the extra dice of the critical hit.

***Flexible Time.*** Time's passage varies between Shavarath's layers. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane; if you spend an hour fighting in the Burning Sky, an hour passes in Eberron. But other layers move at different speeds; you can spend a month in the trenches of Nullius Terram and find that less than three days have passed in Eberron. A creature with proficiency in Arcana can determine the passage of time in their layer by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

### Denizens

All creatures in Shavarath are part of the war, whether they're soldiers, tools, or victims. Those that fight are tied to legions, such as the Legion of Justice or the Legion of Tyranny. The immortals that fight in the war believe that each legion is governed by a higher power--simply called Command--and that these powers collectively shape the layers and determine the terms of battle. Immortals don't question Command or wonder why things are the way they are. Immortals never deal directly with the Command of their legion, and they don't even know if these powers have physical forms.

Vast legions are broken into smaller cohorts, which are in turn divided into centuries of one hundred immortals, each representing an aspect of war like pain, mercy, or despair. A few special centuries and individual immortals can move between layers, but the majority are bound to their cohort and their layer. Immortals can be reassigned to new cohorts, and promoted or demoted--usually tied to a physical transformation. This minimal movement between layers maintains balance, as cohort leaders must make use of the forces in their layer, while legion commanders can strategically direct the centuries that can move between layers--what layer is Justice pressing at the moment?

An offensive's primary goals often focus on destroying an important opponent. The Legion of Justice knows it can't drive Tyranny from Nullius Terram, but defeating Lord Commander Astaralax is an important victory for the light, even though he's an immortal and will eventually return. Sometimes an especially grand victory might cause an immortal to be "discharged"--when this happens, a new being of equivalent power takes its place, but it has a new personality, and the original spirit is eradicated. Such victories are worth even more points in the grand system that calculates the balance of power between the legions.

#### Conscripts

In Nullius Terram, the trenches are filled with miserable soldiers waiting for the offensive. The City of Knives is filled with innocents struggling to survive and looters taking advantage of the chaos. There are dragons in the Burning Sky--but none of these are mortals. They're all manifestations, ideas conscripted to serve the purpose of the story. Conscripts appear to be sentient, but have no depth of personality or memory, can't leave their layers, and can't accomplish anything meaningful unless accompanied by a celestial or fiend. It's only when the angel leads a charge that the conscripts of Nullius Terram matter, and though they inevitably die, they eventually reform. Conscripts can use the statistics of the creatures they appear to be, but may not have their full capabilities; the dragons of the Burning Sky aren't as intelligent as true dragons. A conscript usually appears indistinct; it's hard to focus on them, and it's often easy for a viewer to imagine conscripts are members of their own species.

#### Sword Wraiths

All mortal creatures have a spiritual connection to Shavarath, and there's a sliver of their spirit in the plane. The strength of this sliver is determined by the mortal's courage, willpower, and martial drive. Conscripts are formed from this spiritual energy, but have no awareness and may be formed from multiple slivers; unlike Irian's embers, the conscript doesn't resemble the source.

Sometimes, on the death of a great mortal warrior, echoes of their personality and martial spirit can coalesce into a sword wraith (though its abilities may vary based on the champion it echoes). Unlike standard conscripts, sword wraiths are capable of meaningful action even without the direction of an immortal and can command conscripts of their own. A sword wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of the memories, but it's only an echo of the mortal, much like the traces of memory that allow you to speak with dead. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. If there's a sword wraith of Karrn the Conqueror commanding troops in Nullius Terram, he believes that he's fighting for Karrnath and can't be convinced otherwise; after all, he's only a memory, and there are limits to his ability to reason.

So adventurers might meet Lhazaar as she commands a ship in the Bloody Sea. Dhakaani champions, the Mror clan founders, heroes of the Last War--any of these could be found as sword wraiths, serving the legion that best matches their values. There are sword wraiths of many patron ancestors of the Tairnadal elves; however, these aren't the patrons themselves, simply echoes left behind. While sword wraiths generally form after a mortal's death, the slivers of especially remarkable heroes can manifest sword wraiths even while alive. King Boranel of Breland surely has a sword wraith serving in the Legion of Justice, and it's possible an adventurer could meet their own sword wraith while exploring Shavarath.

#### Whirling Blades

Shavarath's whirling blades are enigmatic and deadly. These manifestations are swarms of animated weapons--knives, swords--that tear through the air, eviscerating anything unfortunate enough to be in their path. Sometimes they follow consistent paths like flocks of birds. Other times, they appear in a flash, lashing at victims, then vanishing. The whirling blades may be a defense mechanism designed to keep mortals from interfering with Shavarath, and the longer mortals remain in Shavarath, the more likely they are to be struck. These blade storms can also leak out into the Material Plane in areas of particularly brutal conflict, spilling blood on all sides.

Whirling blades might take the form of a *cloud of daggers*, though the area and damage might both increase, or the most devastating manifestations could be represented with a *blade barrier* that slowly moves across the terrain.

#### Angels

Most of Shavarath's celestials serve the Legion of Justice, which embodies the concept of war fought for a just cause. Cohorts and their component centuries represent specific concepts within that broad ideal. The Century of Mercy shows kindness to fallen foes, while the Century of the Innocent Guard protects civilians--even if they're just conscripts, the idea of civilians--and avoids collateral damage. Angels won't conscript adventurers, but also won't leave their duties to help them.

The angels of Shavarath have a martial aspect, most appearing clad in armor, with their faces--and species--hidden behind full helms. Any sort of angel can be found in Shavarath, with its power reflecting its position. Planetars command centuries, while each cohort is commanded by a solar or a celestial being of greater power, such as an empyrean. While the angels serve Justice Command, there are a few units also devoted to the Sovereigns. The Century of the Sun asserts that Dol Arrah is Justice Command, and sword wraiths formed from paladins of Dol Arrah serve with this century.

While the Legion of Justice is the largest of the celestial legions, there are others that operate on a smaller scale. Most notable of these is the Legion of Freedom, reflecting the ideal of war fought to end oppression. They rarely field large armies and instead use swift strikes and guerrilla war; these angels embody the idea of champions who fight impossible odds for a noble cause, even if this forces them to follow ignoble paths.

#### Demons

Demons represent the chaotic savagery of war. Most serve the Legion of Cruelty, and are wild, brutal, and far less disciplined than the devilish forces of Tyranny. They torture civilians, have no concern for collateral damage or their own losses, and make little effort to hold territory. Their focus is purely on inflicting maximum damage on foes and their own region alike. The Century of the Salted Earth devastates the regions they fight in, while the Century of Terror creates hideous displays with the corpses of their victims and delights in psychological warfare. The Legion of Cruelty slaughters devils and angels with equal glee, and is despised by Justice and Tyranny alike.

All manner of demons can be found in the Legion of Cruelty; their form reflects their military role, and many wear battered armor, steel scales, or are simply coated in fresh blood. Barlguras and hezrous are brutal shock troops. Chasmes and vrocks flood the skies, while goristros are living siege weapons. Mariliths and balors command centuries, while cohorts may be led by beings with the power of demon princes. As with all immortals of Shavarath, it's important to remember that these demons are first and foremost embodiments of war; regardless of what role a demon might play on another plane, here, it's devoted purely to the eternal war. It could be that there is a Cohort of Bones that uses undead conscripts in battle, commanded by a fiend with the stat block of Orcus--but this commander wouldn't have Orcus's ambitions, instead focusing on crushing the Cohort of the Sun in its layer.

As with angels devoted to the Sovereigns, some demons dedicate themselves and their unit to the Dark Six. Many within the Century of Terror wear the flayed skins of their foes and assert that the Mockery is part of Cruelty Command.

#### Devils

Devils can be just as cruel as demons, but they represent the disciplined practice of war in pursuit of oppression, and most serve the Legion of Tyranny. They seek to crush hope, and no form of treachery or dishonorable conduct is too low for a devil. However, they're far more disciplined than the savage hordes of the Legion of Cruelty, working with precision and careful plans. The Century of Chains forces enemy conscripts (and unlucky adventurers) to fight for them, and uses civilian conscripts as living shields. The Century of the Serpent is always willing to negotiate and makes many pleasing offers, but any agreement inevitably leads to betrayal.

All forms of devils can be found in the Legion of Tyranny. Their sole focus is war; they dominate and corrupt conscripts, but don't seek mortal souls from the Material Plane. Bearded and spined devils serve as basic troops, while elite squads of erinyes descend from the sky. Amnizu and balors command centuries, and beings with the power of archdevils lead cohorts.

The devils of the Cohort of Misery say that the Mockery is part of Tyranny Command, a belief that fuels a bitter enmity with the demons of the Century of Terror. Curiously, the Cohort of the Iron Hand maintains that the Sovereign Aureon leads Tyranny Command, and that they are simply enacting his vision for universal order.

#### Weapons of War

The battlefields of Shavarath contain engines of war unlike anything imagined on Eberron. Steel krakens in the Bloody Sea. Massive cannons that could bring down Sharn's towers with a single volley. Immense monstrosities that serve as living battering rams. However, even the grandest of these creations isn't a product of industry or arcane science--these too are conscripts. The mighty cannon isn't forged in some great foundry, but formed by the layer itself, because it's part of the *idea* of this battle. Fernia is a plane of industry where an artificer might learn amazing techniques from the dao; by contrast, in Shavarath, an artificer might be inspired by what they see, but most of the greatest weapons can't be replicated.

### Layers

Shavarath has countless layers, each one reflecting a different struggle. There's a vicious guerilla war in the Forest of Shadows. The Monolith is a mighty fortress that's always under siege; occasionally, the attackers tear it away from the defenders, at which point the former defenders begin the siege anew. Layers are connected by a network of heavily fortified portals, though the most powerful immortals can shift between layers under their own power. Every legion has a command center or headquarters in the layers in which they operate. The legion might only assign a few centuries to smaller layers, but if a layer's large enough--such as Nullius Terram--it may host an entire cohort.

These are a few examples of layers of Shavarath, but almost any vision of war could spawn a layer.

#### Nullius Terram

One of the largest layers, Nullius Terram is a battlefield the size of a small nation. It's divided by several deep, heavily fortified trenches, which are separated by blasted regions of scorched earth, blast craters, and bones. Nullius Terram's multiple trench lines twist and curve throughout the region, and in the lands between the trenches lie strategic outposts. The region is marked by constant barrages and terrible tools of mass destruction--widescale *cloudkill*, curses that transform conscripts into killers, and worse.

Tyranny, Cruelty, and Justice are the three active legions in this region. Justice has a difficult position in Nullius Terram, but has been slowly gaining strength. Periodically, the commanders send troops to clash in the fields between the lines, either in simple skirmishes or full offensives. Ultimately, the theme of this layer is that of slow, agonizing stalemate, and the suffering war can inflict on both the land and the soldiers.

Nullius Terram is noteworthy for its flowing time; for every 10 minutes that pass in this layer, only 1 minute passes in Eberron. So it's a long, slow struggle--you could spend months here and only miss a week in Eberron.

#### The Burning Sky

The sky is filled with many airships, some large enough to be floating towns. A few islands of rock float amongst the solid clouds, but if there's any land below, it's hidden by deadly fog. While there are skirmishes on the stone islands, most of the action occurs in the skies. Winged angels and fiends circle and duel, while conscripts guide dragons and other aerial mounts.

#### The City of Knives

It looks like this was once a city of marvels, with towers rivaling those of Sharn, gilded monuments, museums, gardens, and more. But the City of Knives lies between vast armies of the Legion of Justice and the Legion of Tyranny, and it represents the impact of brutal war on a glorious city. Ongoing bombardment is a constant threat. The civilian conscripts are fighting their own war for shelter and supplies; some rally together for the common good, while others have become looters and brigands. Justice and Tyranny hold their positions on either side of the city, relying on bombardment and occasional assaults. The Legion of Cruelty spreads terror within the city, while the celestials of the Legion of Freedom seek to rally the common people against all enemies.

#### The Bloody Sea

There are no continents in this aquatic layer, but a handful of islands support the warring fleets. Grand and powerful warships clash in the open waters and bombard settlements. The ships may be familiar, but there are many other unusual engines of war: constructed krakens, submersible warships, monstrosities and dragons bound to service--wonders that the people of Eberron can *imagine* but can't yet create. The pirate queen Lhazaar surely has inspired a sword wraith in the Bloody Sea... but which legion does her sword wraith fight for?

#### The Warring Cities

At first glance, this layer looks like the blasted land between the trenches of Nullius Terram. It's home to a number of warring cities, but they aren't static settlements. Rather, some are floating fortresses that dwarf the Argonth of Breland, and others walk on two legs. The warforged colossus in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* could be used as a model for a small fortress.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few ways Shavarath can affect the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Shavarath often inspire people to violence and aggression, and can convey any of the plane's universal properties. These zones can be dangerous places to dwell, but can also encourage martial discipline and enhance training. While many of the greatest weapons in Shavarath can't be removed from the plane, manifest zones tied to Shavarath can often provide inspiration for artificers and smiths, and it may be possible to craft deadly enchantments in a Shavaran manifest zone that simply aren't possible beyond it.

Manifest zones rarely act as gateways to Shavarath, but anything is possible when Shavarath is coterminous.

#### Coterminous and Remote

When Shavarath is coterminous, people are quick to anger and must be careful to not fight over trivial things. Angry words are more likely to produce brawls, and restless thought to lead to riots or revolutions. The plane's War Magic and Unquenchable Fury properties spread worldwide while it's coterminous, encouraging violence. Meanwhile, in Shavaran manifest zones, outbreaks of intense violence can draw whirling blades into the zone, slaughtering people on all sides.

Shavarath is traditionally coterminous for 1 year every 36 years. Throughout history, some military leaders have plotted campaigns around this, while peaceful communities plan ahead to contain violence. In addition to its regular cycle, Shavarath frequently grows coterminous for a single day; predicting these periods was critical for battle strategy during the Last War. Shavarath is traditionally remote for a year every 36 years, which prevents the occasional single-day coterminous spikes, but otherwise has no apparent effect on the Material Plane.

#### Shavaran Artifacts

Unlike Fernian elementals, the immortals of Shavarath don't create their weapons and tools of war; they're shaped by the plane itself. Many of the grandest weapons--explosives that can level cities, airships the size of small towns--either can't be removed from Shavarath or wouldn't function elsewhere. But Shavarath is a potential source for armor, weapons, and tools of war, from common items to the artifacts wielded by the commanders of cohorts. These may be some of the most powerful weapons in the multiverse--but they're also irreplaceable. You can steal the *Wand of Orra'Cys*, lord of the Cohort of Bones--but he'll certainly want it back, and may deploy demons, warlocks, or other agents to reclaim it.

The legion an item is associated with affects its appearance. Tools of the Legion of Justice are bright and inspiring, while those tied to the Legion of Tyranny are grim and intimidating.

### Shavaran Stories

The simplest story is one of survival, escaping from Shavarath before being destroyed by the endless war. But Shavaran adventures touch the Material Plane too; here are some ideas.

***Blades of War.*** Cannith builds a forgehold for manufacturing weapons on a manifest zone tied to Shavarath. All goes well--until a planar spike unleashes whirling blades and everything is thrown into chaos. Making things worse, some experimental constructs have gone berserk, an experimental Shavaran explosive is detonating in five hours... and it's possible an agent of the Lord of Blades has infiltrated the hold in the chaos. Can the adventurers get things under control?

***The Surge.*** In Fairhaven, an artificer creates an eldritch machine to channel Shavarath's power--but it works too well. When Shavarath becomes coterminous, the eldritch machine amplifies everyone's aggression. Riots and looting break out across the city, while the guards act brutally to contain it. Can the adventurers find and deactivate the machine before the city tears itself apart? Is this the work of a single reckless artificer, or tied to the cult of Rak Tulkhesh or the Order of the Emerald Claw?

***Deadly Weapon.*** The adventurers find a corpse clutching a vorpal sword--the blade of Misery, an erinyes of the Legion of Tyranny. An agent of the Argentum died while attempting to take the blade to a place it could be destroyed. Will the adventurers try to complete the mission, or claim the powerful sword as a trophy? If they choose to keep it, Misery will eventually come looking for her sword... and this cruel immortal will want to take some time to torment any mortals who have sullied her blade.

## Syrania: The Azure Sky

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/189%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

Imagine a perfect blue sky, stretching off into the horizon. There's no sign of the sun, but the sky is clear and bright, and the floating crystal towers gleam as if caught in a sunbeam. A warm, gentle breeze brushes over you, and there's a faint sound of distant chimes. You feel absolutely calm; in this moment, all anger melts away.

This is Syrania, the Azure Sky. While people often think of its floating towers and crystal spires--the same magic that sustains the great towers of Sharn--Syrania is the plane of peace and all that flourishes in peaceful times: commerce, education, reflection. There are no vast armies here, no dangerous monsters. The magic of Syrania allows all creatures to communicate and dispels aggression. As such, it's a common crossroads for beings who do travel the planes, and the Immeasurable Market of Syrania is the safest place to interact with fiends, slaadi, and other extraplanar beings. However, while bloodshed is rare in the Azure Sky, you can still make deadly enemies; mortals are always wise to tread lightly in the cities of angels.

#### Universal Properties

Syrania encourages communication and negotiation, and grants all creatures the gift of flight. The Open Sky of Syrania is an endless void, and without flight, you could fall indefinitely; fortunately, all creatures find that they can move through the air just as naturally as walking.

***Unburdened.*** A creature gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, unless it already has a flying speed greater than or equal to its walking speed, in which case that speed increases by 10 feet.

***Gentle Thoughts.*** A creature has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

***Standard Time.*** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

***Universal Understanding.*** A creature can understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that it hears and can understand any written language that it can see. This doesn't decode secret messages or reveal the meaning of symbols that aren't part of a written language.

***Absolute Peace.*** To make an attack or cast a damaging spell, a creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it doesn't make the attack or cast the spell, but the action is lost.

### Denizens

Syrania is a curiously empty plane. While the Immeasurable Market is always bustling, most of this traffic is comprised of creatures from other planes. Syrania's other spires have comparatively few inhabitants--not so few that they feel desolate or barren, just enough so that it always feels slow and peaceful. There's no need for people to perform menial tasks in Syrania, nor does this plane have manifestations to populate it; damaged structures gradually repair themselves, and litter and debris slowly dissolve.

The native inhabitants of Syrania are winged humanoid immortals, collectively referred to as angels, though they differ from those of other planes in some important ways. While they're considered to be celestials, most angels of Syrania are neutral in alignment. They aren't champions of justice or bringers of hope; rather, they're observers and scholars, defined by their domain of study. The lesser immortals are simply referred to as angels, while the higher orders have titles--virtues, dominions, and thrones. These higher angels are bound to the contemplation of a particular concept, based on their domain, and devote their existence to contemplating and understanding it. Some believe that it's through this contemplation that the concept continues to exist (though most inhabitants of other places--mortal and immortal alike--consider this to be highly unlikely). The appearance of Syranian angels is influenced by their domain, so the Dominion of Storms might be wreathed in lightning and have wings formed of storm clouds, while the Dominion of Trees could have bark for skin and moss for hair.

Unlike lesser angels and visitors to Syrania, virtues, dominions, and thrones are immune to the effects of Syrania's Absolute Peace property, and are capable of taking aggressive action to defend Syrania, or when pursuing their domain--so a virtue of war could fight. However, they always try to find nonviolent or nonlethal solutions to threats.

#### Angels

Angels are the least of the immortals of Syrania. They have no names or domains and are generally interchangeable; they serve as scribes and guides, performing minor tasks. They do not engage in combat and their statistics are largely inconsequential.

#### Virtues

Virtues are a higher order of angel, with names and broad domains--*Hazari, Virtue of Nature*. They act as assistants and emissaries of the dominions. Virtues spend much of their time contemplating their domain, but they also gather information for their dominions--either by fetching existing records within Syrania, talking with creatures who visit the plane, or by venturing beyond Syrania and discretely observing. A dominion is always aware of everything that happens to its virtues and immediately knows all information they collect. Virtues typically use the stat blocks of devas, and they change their forms to conceal their presence while gathering intelligence. The "Syranian Domains" sidebar provides examples of some domains; it's possible that a virtue might be able to cast a couple additional spells that are associated with their domain, though they'll not know the full list. They can only use commune to answer questions tied to their domain, and can cast *plane shift* once per day, but only when acting in the direct service of a dominion.

#### Dominions

Dominions focus on a very specific aspect of a single domain, like wolves or swords. They have names and specific domains, along with extra titles for pomp--*Tezaria, Angel of the Storm, Dominion of the Seventh Spire*. They typically spend their time in contemplation and use virtues as their eyes and hands, but occasionally a dominion acts directly--especially if its spire is threatened in some way. As neutral observers, dominions have no sympathy for mortals, but they're often willing to discuss their domain with a mortal who has an interesting perspective on it.

It's important to recognize the difference between a warrior angel of Shavarath and a dominion of Syrania with the domain of War. The Shavaran is an angel who fights wars, and this has no place in peaceful Syrania. On the other hand, the dominion of Syrania--perhaps called the Angel of Swords--*understands* war, and in particular, knows everything there is to know about a single thing: swords. They know sword-fighting techniques from every mortal and immortal culture. They can recognize any sword, know the locations of a number of long-forgotten legendary blades, and may have a few in their possession. They're likely one of the deadliest swordfighters in existence, but they don't actually desire to fight, because that's not the point: they are the Angel of Swords, and they contemplate swords.

Dominions often use the statistics of a **planetar**, substituting the spells and skills on the "Syranian Domains" sidebar; however, they maintain the ability to cast *detect evil and good* and *invisibility* at will, and use the latter to move unseen when observing on the Material Plane. Dominions might also possess additional abilities reflecting their absolute knowledge of their domain. For example, the Angel of Swords could be immune to any damage inflicted by a sword; perhaps they know perfectly how to defend against such an attack, or the sword itself might even refuse to strike them.

> ##### Syranian Domains

>Each virtue, dominion, and throne is dedicated to contemplation and mastery of a domain. Here are some example domains, along with skills and spells that any dominion or throne dedicated to it would likely have; virtues might also be able to cast a couple spells from their associated domain.

#### Thrones

The greatest angels of Syrania are the thrones. There's a single throne for each domain, and they have a profound knowledge of their entire domain. Unlike lesser angels, thrones are known only by their domain, with no other name--*the Throne of War*. They're bound to all the dominions whose studies lie within their domain, and they know everything experienced by those dominions. They largely remain in deep contemplation, acting only if Syrania itself is threatened or if a dominion succumbs to corruption. A throne has powers equal to or greater than a solar, though when using spells such as *commune*, it can only answer questions tied to its domain. A throne also has access to the skills and spells on the "Syranian Domains" sidebar. As a bonus action, a throne can strip the benefits of Syrania's Unburdened property for any number of creatures it can see--so flightless creatures who cause trouble may find themselves falling forever through the Open Sky.

The thrones are the most powerful entities that can be encountered by mortals, but many sages assume that they are themselves tied to a greater force who knows everything that they experience, and who shapes the plane itself.

### Layers

Rather than being divided into separate layers in the same way as many other planes, Syrania is comprised of crystal spires floating in the seemingly infinite void of the Open Sky. The space within a spire may be far larger than it appears from the outside, whether the spire leads to the multiple towers of the University or the vast expanse of the Immeasurable Market. However, all of these regions are connected through the medium of the spires and the Open Sky.

The majority of spires aren't all that vast. Most are the seats of a dominion, who is attended by a few virtues and additional angels as needed. These have the general flavor of a library or museum, with additional facilities to allow the dominion to practice or study its subject. The spire of a dominion of nature has gardens, while the tower of a dominion of war has displays of armor and a dueling chamber. But these are still places for study and contemplation; the seat of a dominion of war isn't an impenetrable fortress, and the spire of a dominion of nature has cultivated gardens, not the wilderness one finds in Irian and Lamannia.

#### The Open Sky

The Open Sky is the vast blue expanse from which the Azure Sky takes its name. The clear, bright, sunless sky shows no signs of passing time; the moon Therendor can be seen, but it doesn't move or have phases. Despite the Open Sky's seemingly infinite space, it wraps around on itself, effectively making it a 300-mile cube. So while it takes a significant time to travel between the farthest points, it is possible. There are no native threats in the Open Sky, and all visitors to Syrania have the ability to fly; the catch is knowing where to go, as there are hundreds of spires.

#### The University

The pursuit of knowledge and education are things that flourish in times of peace. While most dominions are devoted to their own personal contemplation, the Throne of Knowledge maintains the University of Syrania, where chosen students can study an astonishing array of subjects with virtues of knowledge and the occasional guest dominion. The catch is that students need to be admitted... and there isn't actually a process for applying. At the moment, the University only has twenty students, chosen from across the planes by roaming virtues.

For planar travelers who come to Syrania, the University is a good repository of general knowledge; if the scholarly virtues can't help, they'll likely know the way to a dominion that can. It's also an unusual background for a player character; perhaps a Divine Soul sorcerer unlocked their powers at the University, or perhaps a warlock's Celestial patron is their thesis advisor. And it's a very exotic option for a university group patron...

#### The Immesurable Market

While most planes are isolated from others and it's difficult to move from one plane to another, commerce and peaceful interaction are defining aspects of Syrania. Most planes have back doors that lead to the Immeasurable Market. The crystal spire in the Open Sky is merely a gateway leading to an open marketplace that extends as far as the eye can see. To one side, a slaadi haggles with a modron over the price of hippogriff eggs; to the other, a sly dao shows a Shavaran balor a selection of Fernia-forged blades. It's said that anything you can imagine--and many things you can't--can be found in the Immeasurable Market.

The Immeasurable Market includes customers and merchants from across the planes, including the Material Plane; there are a few back doors to the Market hidden on Eberron, and those who find them can make a healthy profit trading in exotic goods. It also includes a significant number of native immortals. Angels work as servers and porters, while virtues of commerce run small stands and shops. Dominions of commerce run the largest and most reliable businesses, while the Throne of Commerce monitors the entire Market and banishes troublemakers.

There are countless merchants in the Market. Most have temporary stands or tents, but there are a few permanent structures scattered about; the Last Resort is the most beloved watering hole in the planes. The Immeasurable Merchants table provides a few examples of merchants and shops adventurers could discover.

Violence is forbidden in the Market, and thieves and other criminals are generally deported to Daanvi for judgment and punishment. While merchants always try to get the best deal, when dealing with immortal customers, your reputation is everything. Beyond this, oaths made in the Market carry great weight, and can be enforced in the courts of Daanvi; in the Immeasurable Market, your word truly is your bond. This is important, because most of the merchants aren't interested in gold, and goods and services usually involve barter. The Immeasurable Currencies table gives a few examples of things that can be used in trade, but this is just a starting point; the DM should feel free to come up with other offers.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are some ways that Syrania affects the Material Plane.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Syrania can reflect one or more of the properties of the plane, but often in more limited ways. The manifest zone containing the city of Sharn has a lesser aspect of the Unburdened property; it doesn't grant flight, but it enhances effects that grant flight or levitation, enabling the skycoaches and flying buttresses that support the towers. A zone that has the Absolute Peace property might have a lower DC for the saving throw, or it might encourage peaceful behavior without actively enforcing it. Temples are often built on Syranian zones with the Absolute Peace property, while universities and House Sivis search for zones with the Universal Understanding property.

In addition to standard manifest zones, there are a few portals to the Immeasurable Market hidden in Eberron. These take many forms; a back door could be an actual door, a large chest, or a shallow pool of water. A back door only opens under specific circumstances: when opened with a special key, when used at a certain time, when blood is spilled, or when a heart is broken. Most who discover these portals jealously guard them; a merchant with access to the Immeasurable Market can acquire remarkable goods!

#### Coterminous and Remote

When Syrania is coterminous, goodwill spreads across the world and people find it nearly impossible to contemplate violence. These periods brought welcome moments of peace during the Last War, and there are stories of enemy soldiers coming together to share stories or play games. During these times, the Absolute Peace and Gentle Thoughts properties apply across Eberron. However, if a creature is attacked, harmed by a spell, or witnesses its friends being harmed, that creature is unaffected by Absolute Peace for one minute. The influence of Syrania limits violence, but once conflicts break out, it can't stop them.

While Syrania is coterminous, the skies are clear and the weather is calm--it's believed that if you're in a Syranian manifest zone during this time, it's possible to fly into the Open Sky simply by flying straight up to the edge of the sky. This may be apocryphal or only true in certain manifest zones... there's only one way to find out!

When Syrania is remote, the skies are gray and the sun can't be seen. People feel quarrelsome and it's difficult to come to an understanding. Creatures have disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Outside of Syranian manifest zones, all flying speeds are reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet.

Traditionally, Syrania is coterminous on the 9th day of the month of Rhaan, once every ten years. Followers of the Sovereign Host celebrate this day every year as Boldrei's Feast, a time for people to come together and resolve their grievances; the tenth-year coterminous celebrations are especially grand. Syrania is remote once every ten years on the same day, five years after the coterminous period. This day is still celebrated, as people make a conscious effort not to give into anger.

#### Syranian Artifacts

Syrania's greatest treasure is the Immeasurable Market itself, with all manner of exotic goods available there. Many of the dominions of Syrania are more interested in collecting relics tied to their domain than in creating them, but there are a few who do both; the limits of what they can produce are tied to their domain.

Other Syranian items are usually linked to the plane's universal properties. The power of Syrania enhances flight; there's a stall in the Market that sells *wings of flying* that resemble the wings of an angel. Things that encourage or enforce peace may come from Syrania, along with items that enhance a character's diplomatic ability.

### Syranian Stories

Wandering angels can stumble into any story, and the Immeasurable Market is a boon for adventurers lucky enough to find it. The Last Resort can be an interesting place for a powerful enemy to arrange a meeting; what safer place for neutral negotiations than on the plane of peace? Given the versatility and opportunities available in the Immeasurable Market, a DM may wish to limit access to Syrania; even if adventurers find a back door, it could open only at certain times or require a particular sacrifice.

***Curious Virtue.*** After the adventurers acquire a curious object that defies any attempt to divine its powers and history, a hireling or observer is revealed to be a Syranian angel that's observing the adventurers. The item is a powerful extraplanar artifact; the virtue doesn't want to take it from them, but rather, to observe the effect it has on its bearer and the world around them. The virtue is the key to unlocking the powers of this powerful artifact... but how do the characters feel about being subjects of a celestial case study?

***Pursuit through the Market.*** After the adventurers acquire a curious object that defies any attempt to divine its powers and history, a hireling or observer is revealed to be a Syranian angel that's observing the adventurers. The item is a powerful extraplanar artifact; the virtue doesn't want to take it from them, but rather, to observe the effect it has on its bearer and the world around them. The virtue is the key to unlocking the powers of this powerful artifact... but how do the characters feel about being subjects of a celestial case study?

***Celestial Knowledge.*** The adventurers need to obtain a particularly obscure piece of information, and the only being that might possess it is a dominion of knowledge in Syrania. Can the adventurers find a way to reach the celestial's library spire? What does it want in exchange for its knowledge--and will the adventurers try to pay this price, or steal the information they need?

> ##### Fallen Angels
>
>Syranian virtues sometimes travel to the Material Plane to conduct research for their dominion, concealing their true nature through magic or invisibility, and trying to minimize their interactions with mortals. Occasionally, a dominion wishes to experience the Material Plane for itself, perhaps pursuing a lead or studying a particularly interesting group of subjects. However, this venture can be quite dangerous, for even angels fall.
>
>Many sages believe that touching Eberron's ground makes angels vulnerable to the influence of Khyber and the overlords, while others theorize that mortal worship--the positive energy that sustains the Undying Court--is like a drug to the dominions. Whatever the cause, dominions who interact with mortals run the risk of becoming corrupted. Such immortals crave mortal adoration and often seek to dominate mortals by exercising the power of their sphere.
>
>Not all dominions fall prey to this corruption, but once one does, there seems to be no way to undo it. Even if the angel is destroyed and reforms, the corruption remains. It's unlikely that such an angel would be met in Syrania itself; typically, these corrupted angels are forever stripped of the power of flight and condemned to walk the Material Plane as **radiant idols**.

## Thelanis: The Faerie Court

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/194%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

Every culture has faerie tales--stories that use exaggeration and supernatural elements to warn children of the consequences of bad behavior or to demonstrate the virtues of society. Breland tells tales of the Sleeping Prince, cursed to slumber by a cruel hag until he's saved by the courage of the Woodcutter's Daughter. In the Mror Holds, there's a tale older than Breland itself, in which Lady Narathun curses Doldarun's son with eternal sleep, until he's saved by humble Toldorath. And the Dhakaani dar have an ancient story about how Hezhaal--a dirge singer who betrayed the empire and studied sinister magic--cast the marhu's son into a cursed slumber, until he was saved by a simple golin'dar.

This is just one of many stories that appear over and over in different cultures. The exact details may shift--is the sleeper a prince? The marhu's son? Doldarun's heir?--while the thrust of the tale and the lessons it teaches persist. But long before any of these cultures arose, these stories existed somewhere else. In a layer of Thelanis, the Lady in Shadow curses a prince with eternal sleep. She tends a garden full of wonders, and keeps her own daughter hidden in the heart of a labyrinth of thorns. At the deepest level, that is what the fey are: stories. The dryad isn't a natural spirit; it's the magic we want in the world when we see a slender tree move in the wind and imagine it as a beautiful person. Thelanis is built on iconic stories, but it's also the Faerie Court; at its heart, satyrs and nymphs dance in the shadows of the Palace of the Moon, while the archfey engage in immortal intrigues. It's a fantastic realm essentially built around the idea of adventures, but it's a deadly place for those who refuse to understand its rules.

Thelanis is one of the easiest planes for mortals to reach. Just walk through a mushroom ring when Rhaan is full in the sky, or follow the sound of distant music in the forest. It's not always this easy, but it can be. One wrong step and you could find yourself in Thelanis, retracing the steps of storybook heroes and making dangerous bargains with the rulers of the Faerie Court.

#### Universal Properties

Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.

***Enchanted Realm.*** Saving throws against illusion or enchantment spells have disadvantage. When a creature casts an illusion or enchantment spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.

***Storybook Logic.*** No two layers of Thelanis are exactly alike. Each is driven by its story, and any rule can be overridden by a particular tale. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent; in the Valley of Stolen Fire, all fire damage becomes cold damage. Ability checks using particular skills could have advantage or disadvantage. In one layer, spells that restore hit points might have no effect; in another, a glass of wine could act as a *potion of healing*. But while these effects vary from layer to layer, they are entirely reliable within that layer and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story.

***Words Have Power.*** In Thelanis, words--and particularly promises--have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise. The price varies, a slightly broken promise to a greater fey might simply result in a run of bad luck, with disadvantage on the next few rolls. On the other hand, a promise to an archfey could inherently carry the power of a geas. The fey themselves are bound by this restriction--though they are aware of it and are exceedingly careful with their promises.

***Chaotic Time.*** Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from layer to layer. It's possible for adventurers to spend a night in Thelanis, then discover that a year has passed in Eberron. But it's equally possible for a group of adventurers to find a layer where they save a kingdom and reign as kings and queens... only to stumble through a gate many years later and discover that only an hour has passed in their homes. Often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron--either swiftly aging them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades of time spent in Thelanis.

### Denizens

Thelanis is home to fey in all their forms. Sprites flit between trees, singing to the dryads that dwell within them. There are birds in the trees, and if you talk to them, one might answer--either a bird or a tree, depending on the story. Most of the denizens of Thelanis fall into one of four categories.

#### Supporting Cast

The vast majority of the creatures of Thelanis--the sprites in the forest, the dryads, the birds, and for that matter, the trees themselves--are manifestations. These members of the supporting cast exist because the story needs them to exist, and they have a specific role to play. While most supporting cast are fey, any creature can appear if the story requires it. A pack of wolves? An angry giant? A white horse that appears just when it's needed? Anything is possible.

Supporting cast generally use the standard stat blocks for each creature, though they might be considered fey instead of other creature types. These creatures don't think of themselves as manifestations; it's simply that they have no real depth, no desires other than the drives they need to fill their role in the story, and no care for the passage of time. The sprite never gets bored of its song, and it never stops to question anything about its existence.

The supporting cast reflects the fact that the stories of Thelanis don't change. The hungry giant will always be guarding the well. If adventurers defeat the giant, they're the heroes of the hour and it feels like a triumph; but if they return to the barony at a later date, the giant will be back--or at least, a remarkably similar giant--and it won't remember them or acknowledge their previous victory. As a general rule, supporting cast can't abandon their posts or leave their layers.

However, more than the manifestations of other planes, the supporting cast of Thelanis can evolve. When an anchor baron gives the white horse to an adventurer, it becomes a mortal horse and they can ride it home. Supporting cast that drift into manifest zones become mortal fey, dwelling in the zone until they die. A supporting cast member can also evolve by gaining a greater role in the story. An individual sprite doesn't even have a name, but if the adventureres convince the sprite to help them, and it plays a critical role in their defeat of the giant at the well, it's no longer a nameless sprice; it's Clever Jack, or whatever name they gave it. If a manifestation becomes mortal, it can go anywhere it likes, even leaving its layer and following the adventureres back to Eberron... but if it dies, it's gone forever. On the other hand, a manifestation can evolve to become a greater fey; if this happens, it remains immortal, and it's still tied to its story, just with a bigger role and more personality.

#### Eladrin and Other Mortals

There are two types of mortals in Thelanis. The first are the supporting cast that have become real and split off from their original stories. The second are natural-born mortals who do have their own cultures and cities; chief among these are the eladrin, who dwell in the feyspires of the Moonlit Vale. Each spire is ruled by an archfey, and each has a distinct story that shapes the personality of the local eladrin. The eladrin aren't as bound by story as other fey, but the magic of the plane encourages a deep devotion to their spire and their ruler. They hunt, they hold revels, they serve their ruler in the intrigues of the Moon Court; it rarely occurs to them that there could be more to life. However, they're indeed mortals; they fall in love, they have children, they are born, and they die. If an eladrin leaves their spire--whether to roam across Thelanis or into Eberron--they often gain a greater appreciation of the passage of time. Living among mortals in a mundane world can be a hard transition for an eladrin; compared to the wonders of the Faerie Court, there is little fey beauty in Khorvaire. The longer an eladrin lives in the mortal world, the more mortal it becomes; this is why eladrin player characters are considered humanoids (and elves) rather than fey.

For the eladrin of Thelanis, the seasonal aspect remains a statement of their current mood and nature. However, seasons are also used as a political statement, reflecting a degree of support for that season in the Moon Court; there may be times when an eladrin will resist assuming a particular aspect so as not to offend a host.

The eladrin are the most common mortals in the layer, but there are also a handful of mortals who have been drawn in from Eberron--the gnomes of Pylas Pyrial, wandering Greensingers, mortals personally chosen by one of the archfey, or creatures who accidentally wandered through manifest zones and are trying to find their way home.

#### Greater Fey

Greater fey are tied to a barony or have a role in the Moonlit Vale, but they have their own names, identities, and distinct personalities. They can have their own agendas and schemes within the grander story of the archfey, seeking love or revenge or other ambitions. Sometimes the protagonist of the story appears as a greater fey; in the case of the Sleeping Prince, perhaps the adventurers can actually meet the clever Woodcutter's Daughter. However, often the role of protagonist is left for the adventurers to fill; in Thelanis, *they* are the ones who must wake the Sleeping Prince.

Despite their individuality, these greater fey are still fey; they remain attached to their layers, and don't experience the passage of time as mortals do. They want to achieve things within their story, but few have any thoughts or desires that go beyond Thelanis. However, it's possible for them to go wherever they want. A greater fey could establish its own domain in a manifest zone tied to Thelanis, or be found selling strange trinkets in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania. When greater fey do leave Thelanis, they generally seek to create their own stories; they still want to be part of a narrative that makes sense to them.

Any fey creature can be used as a basic foundation for a greater fey, possibly with additional powers tied to the story they tell. A greater dryad might be able to see through all of the trees in the manifest zone she calls home, and to control its beasts. This isn't represented by a spell, as she couldn't control beasts in other places; it's simply part of the story.

As the story of a greater fey grows, its abilities can grow as well... but these are often tied to storybook logic, and power could be balanced by a weakness. A greater dryad could be immune to fire unless someone knows her name, at which point she is vulnerable to it. Or she might be immune to piercing damage but vulnerable to slashing damage--arrows and spears refuse to strike her, but axes hunger to cut her down.

#### Archfey and Anchor Barons

The archfey are the foundation of Thelanis, the force that sets a story in motion. Where greater fey may be tied to a single story, most archfey have inspired countless tales--often as the antagonist, though they can also be benevolent. The Lady in Shadow is the archetype of the mighty witch who lives apart from society, whose anger can bring a terrible curse. She's the villain of the Sleeping Prince, but she also curses those who steal from her secret garden, and may have advice for those who approach her carefully and with gifts. In some cases, stories refer to the archfey by name. When something goes missing in the Five Nations, people in Eberron know the Forgotten Prince stole it; his story is explored in chapter 8. Other archfey inspire tales, but those stories are seen through a local lens. The Lady in Shadow set the story of the Sleeping Prince in motion long ago, but in Eberron, the villain of the story is Lady Narathun, or Hezhaal the dirge singer, or Sora Katra. This is fine with the Lady in Shadow; she doesn't need mortals to know her name.

Many archfey dwell in the Moonlit Vale. Some rule over feyspires, while others dwell in the Palace of the Moon; the intrigues of the Court aretheir defining stories. Archfey that rule layers are known as anchor barons, as each is the anchor that defines the barony. They come to the Palace of the Moon for revels or conclaves, but prefer to dwell in their own story.

Archfey possess great power within Thelanis and its manifest zones, but to act in the world beyond, they need agents. Some recruit agents directly, working with Greensingers or training warlocks or other emissaries; an archfey could serve as an immortal group patron for a group of adventurers. Typically, an archfey wants its agents to take actions relating to its story; the Forgotten Prince charges his agents to steal secrets and unloved things. Others don't want agents; they want mortals to reenact their stories, as in many versions of the Sleeping Prince. Hezhaal the dirge singer really did curse the marhu's son long ago, and Sora Katra is another real person who just happens to resemble the Lady in Shadow in some ways. Neither Katra nor Hezhaal knowingly served the Lady in Shadow--but she may have secretly aided them, or placed gifts or obstacles in their paths that might make them reenact the stories, unknowingly becoming avatars of the archfey. Archfey can't be permanently killed; as long as their stories are told, the archfey will reform. However, this usually involves a greater fey being promoted to fill the role; the archfey still exists, but they aren't exactly the same as the one that came before.

Chapter 8 includes two archfey, the Forest Queen and the Forgotten Prince, along with descriptions of their layers, their goals, and how they can assist adventurers--or oppose them. Additional archfey are mentioned in the Archfey of Thelanis table, just a few examples of the dozens in Thelanis. In creating new archfey, consider the stories that are told about them and how those stories could play out again in the current campaign.

### Layers

Much like Kythri, Dal Quor, and Syrania, Thelanis has a core layer surrounded by lesser layers. The heart of Thelanis is the Moonlit Vale, where all archfey gather for their revels. This is surrounded by endless baronies, each embodying the stories of a particular archfey. While eladrin and fey can shift between layers, it's more challenging for mortals to travel to a barony; this often requires a token from that realm, or for the mortals to act out some aspect of its story.

Regardless of the specific identity of a layer, Thelanis always feels magical and otherworldy. Its environments are typically vibrant and beautiful, but if they are harsh and ugly, they are exceptionally so. It feels like a story, exaggerated and unreal.

#### The Moonlit Vale

This is the largest layer of Thelanis and the heart of the plane. The Moonlit Vale is essentially a country, with the feyspires spread across it as cities; it's possible to spend days traveling from spire to spire. While it's largely arboreal, there are beautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. It's always night here, and the moon Rhaan radiates bright light, always seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon doesn't move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court is covered in snow, while in spring, it's in brilliant flower. This has nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to do with the intrigues of the Palace of the Moon; the current season indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant. This is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: *things change*. The baronies are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the four seasons are the story Thelanis tells itself.

The Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the fey--otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of illusion--streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The beasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual colors and patterns; while many use standard stat blocks, sentient beasts might use the statistics for Valenar beasts from *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* (though these aren't in any way related to the Tairnadal). The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have advantage on foraging checks... though hunting without permission may incur the wrath of the local fey.

The grandest city in the Moonlit Vale is the Palace of the Moon. Its towers are built into the trunks of four vast trees, each one reflecting the influence of a particular season. The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer. At the apex of each season--perhaps a strangely arbitrary declaration in a realm with such a casual relationship to time--the fey of the ruling season host a grand revel, which draws archfey from all throughout the plane; this is a moment when intrigues bloom and stories are shaped, a time for duels and grand declarations.

The feyspires are the cities of the Moonlit Vale. Each is home to a single archfey whose personal story is reflected by the spire, along with a few greater fey and a host of eladrin and other mortals. Many feyspires serve as planar beachheads; they are tied to specific manifest zones in Eberron, and when the time is right, they can slip into Eberron for a short time. Usually the feyspires are hidden by powerful illusions during these times, but there are stories of people stumbling into magical cities that are gone the next day. In fourth edition, the *Eberron Campaign Guide* explored the idea that feyspires could be trapped in Eberron following the Mourning; it's up to a DM to decide if that's the story they want to tell. Here are a few notable feyspires:

- **Pylas Pyrial.** is the Gate of Joy, celebrated for its bards and revels. Tied to Zilargo, it has a significant gnome population.
- **Shae Joridal.** is the City of Emerald Lights; its illusionists are legendary. It appears in what is now Darguun.
- **Shae Loralyndar.** is the City of Rose and Thorn, an arboreal spire frequently found in the Twilight Demesne of the Eldeen Reaches. Many Greensingers have close ties to this city.
- **Shae Tirias Tolai.** is the City of Silver and Bone. Tied to Xen'drik, it was sacked by the giants of the Cul'sir Dominion and never reclaimed; some believe the elves of Eberron are descended from the eladrin of Shae Tirias Tolai. Today, it's a haunted ruin, shunned by the fey.
- **Shaelas Tiraleth.** is the Court of the Silver Tree, largest of the feyspires. Its ruler, Shan Tira, is a master diviner and gifted oracle. All archfey respect her words, and she serves as a mediator between the seasons of the Moon Court. The spire is tied to Cyre, and there are stories that suggest the first Princess Cyre herself may have been a student of Shan Tira.
- **Taer Syraen.** is the Winter Citadel, seat of the Prince of Frost. This martial spire appears in a barren region of Karrnath. It's closely allied with the winter fey of the Moon Court.

#### The Baronies

Each barony is a collection of layers that embody the stories of their anchor baron. Only one archfey is found in each barony, and it is a serious transgression for another archfey to enter a barony uninvited, as their presence disrupts the story. Each barony is unique, but the layers are often quite small, reflecting the events of a familiar tale... though not all of the stories of Thelanis are known to every culture in Khorvaire! A few are described below, but there are many more.

The Endless Weald and the Castle of Forgotten Things are described in chapter 8; these are the baronies of the Forest Queen and the Forgotten Prince.

The Assembly is the barony of the Forge Maiden. Here, innovation is celebrated, and any artificer spell cast in this layer is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. But while there are a few stories of how things go well, there are many where inventions go terribly wrong: the construct dragon that has claimed the workshop and gathered a hoard; the labyrinth the Maiden designed so well that she became lost in it; the *time stop* spell that can't be undone. Wondrous (and impossible) artifacts can be found here, but so can many dangers.

The Shadow is the barony of the Lady in Shadow, with branches reflecting the many tales of this sinister figure. It includes a tiny kingdom, which serves as the set for the Sleeping Prince and similar tales; the kingdom is often named Whitestone, though this can change. The secret garden of the Lady is walled and protected by dangerous plant creatures, but holds imaginary flowers that an alchemist could use to do amazing things. The Lady's tower is hidden within a maze of thorns. Any story dealing with a sinister spellcaster dwelling on the edge of civilization could be found here.

Folly is the barony of Fortune's Fool. Here, great misfortunes regularly occur, but invariably lead to unlikely success. In this layer, d20 rolls of 5 or below are always considered a 1, and rolls of 16 or above are always considered a 20. Folly contains a charming village and a number of threats--a dragon, a giant--that can't be defeated with weapons alone. However, skill checks can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it may take time for the adventurers to discover this.

### Planar Manifestations

Here are a few ways Thelanis can affect the world.

#### Manifest Zones

More than with any other plane, Thelanian manifest zones often allow travel between the planes. Fey creatures dwell in such zones, and a greater fey may turn such a manifest zone into its personal domain. Just as fey can cross over from Thelanis, mortals can travel to the Faerie Court. Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it's rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway--circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times--often when the moon Rhaan is full--and even then, there's usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won't stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That's on you.

Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word--and if you are false, you'll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove... will you?

A final form of manifest zone is the beachhead; this phenomenon periodically draws a piece of Thelanis into Eberron. The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location--sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There's a tale in the Mror Holds of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, bestowing curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen... or until they die.

#### Coterminous and Remote

When Thelanis is coterminous, new gateway zones spring up. Mischievous or cruel fey may cross over, and it's far easier for careless travelers to cross over. However, there are always warning signs, and you generally must break some superstition or taboo to be pulled through. Thus, when people know the planes are coterminous, they are cautious to remember the stories and avoid foolish behavior.

When Thelanis is remote, the effects of Thelanian manifest zones are suppressed. Fey creatures may be temporarily drawn back to Thelanis, even those that normally dwell on Eberron. In general, the world feels less magical.

Traditionally, Thelanis becomes coterminous for a period of 7 years every 225 years, and it is remote for 7 years halfway between these cycles. However, there is evidence, such as beachheads remaining in place longer than usual, that something has disrupted this cycle. This may be a result of the Mourning... or it could be that the Mourning is just an easy excuse, and the true story is tied to the schemes of an archfey or a mortal mastermind. Nonetheless, no one knows when Thelanis will become coterminous again--or how long the phase might last when it does.

#### Thelanian Artifacts

Thelanis can be a source of wondrous magical items. The simplest deal with illusion or enchantment: *eyes of charming* or a *hat of disguise*. But any sort of magic item can come from Thelanis--the catch is that Thelanian items invariably have a story attached to them. The *berserker axe* that can't be released until it kills someone you love. The *dragon slayer* that calls out to dragons, summoning wyverns for you to fight and drawing the attention of agents of the Chamber. The *crystal ball* that occasionally shows glimpses of things you don't want to know.

Thelanian items can also hold curses that come with no accompanying benefit. The *mithral falcon* is a statue that amplifies existing greed. Generous people are unaffected by its magic, but greedy folk feel a growing need to claim the *falcon* from its current owner. The *falcon* can start a gang war between criminal organizations, or turn Aurum concordians into the bitterest of enemies. The *falcon* has no beneficial powers, but its curse can drive a story.

### Thelanian Stories

Thelanian stories can start before a campaign begins. With the DM's permission, any character or party could be connected to an archfey, for better or for worse. Here are a few examples.

***The Patron.*** Whether serving as patron for a warlock or an entire party, an archfey could work with adventurers, providing magical benefits--perhaps spells from the artificer or bard lists, or boons and magic items--in exchange for the character's services. It could be that the patron's goals are tied to the intrigues of the Moon Court or to some element of its story. It might want the characters to deal with the warlock agents of another archfey. Or it could be that the archfey is trying to get the adventurers to reenact its story in the present day, to have a character serve as an avatar for the archfey--or as the avatar for one of its enemies.

***Blessing or Curse?.*** You don't have to be a warlock to draw powers from an archfey. An artificer could have been blessed by the Forge Maiden; their artifice isn't arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things. A barbarian's rage could be a curse from the Lady in Shadow, laid upon an ancestor and handed down through generations. All other members of the character's family have eventually been killed by their fury; does the barbarian seek to break the curse, or do they just want to live as wild a life as possible before it consumes them?

***Faerie Tales.*** The archfey and the baronies are the source of faerie tales. You can draw from beloved tales in our own world to craft any adventure, adding an Eberron twist. Using these tropes gives the players a sense of familiarity with the story, just as the people of Eberron are familiar with these archetypal tales, played out time and time again across cultures and generations. So, the Sleeping Prince clearly follows the same basic principles as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, but with an Eberron twist--it's Sora Katra and the prince of Breland!

***The Actual Changeling.*** As a child, any character could have wandered through a manifest zone, stumbled into a feyspire, or even caught the eye of an archfey and been carried off to Thelanis. A bard could have learned their craft in Pylas Pyrial. A druid's abilities might be tied less to nature and more to the magic of the fey. It might be that a warlock doesn't have a patron, but they're the adopted child of the Lady in Shadow and learned her tricks by watching her. If this is the case, is the character welcome to one day return to Thelanis, or were they cast out of it? Did the Lady in Shadow encourage her child to leave, or did the adventurer escape from the maze of thorns where they were held prisoner (for their own good, of course)? Does the character have a fey lover or rival in Thelanis? With the DM's permission, such a changeling--of any race--could replace their background feature with the Fey Nature feature provided in the sidebar.

> ##### Variant Feature: Fey Nature
>
>Due to the time you've spent in Thelanis, you feel more comfortable with the fey than your own kind, and can often find a welcome with them. This provides no protection from hostile fey, but fey that aren't aggressive are more likely to talk with you, and might provide you with safe passage through their territory or even share stories. Lesser fey are also hidden across the world--minor spirits that dwell in cupboards and clearings--and these spirits might emerge to offer you minor aid or advice. Just don't forget that you're always expected to offer payment for services you receive, even if it's just a gift of food or a song.

## Xoriat: The Realm of Madness

![Artist: Marco Ma4ps Bernardini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/199%20marco%20ma4ps%20bernardini.png)

The touch of Xoriat will warp your flesh and corrupt your mind. The inhabitants of this alien realm seek to transform or destroy all that is natural, and even the slightest contact with it is dangerous.

At least, that's the popular opinion--but it's not entirely true. The plane's title, "Realm of Madness," is a label applied by the people of Eberron based on the perception that close interaction with Xoriat can interfere with your ability to process reality. But illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations... and this may be more accurate. Where Lamannia embodies the natural world, Xoriat instead embodies the unnatural. It's a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don't see, ones they're ill-equipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace--all of these are inventions. They're the foundations mortal lives are built on... but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.

Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat. Mortals dream in Dal Quor. Shavarath sparks mortal anger. Mabar feeds mortal shadows, while Irian holds their spark of light. When mortals die, their souls are drawn to Dolurrh. Mortals are influenced by all of the planes, and the influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat's also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn't evil or destructive. It's part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, Lamannia is the blueprint for nature, Daanvi provides guiding order. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been--and of the unseen ways it *is*.

#### Universal Properites

To mortal eyes, Xoriat may seem more chaotic than Kythri. However, it's not defined by the idea of chaos; rather, mortals don't understand the logic that guides its changes. Additionally, Kythri's constant change is still always natural: fire and lightning, stone and water. On the other hand, in Xoriat, a tornado might be composed of ink. Each grain in a sandstorm could be a miniature bust of Queen Aurala of Aundair, or a tiny beating heart. It's not simply chaotic; it's unnatural.

***Unpredictable Magic.*** Immediately after a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the *Player's Handbook*.

***Dangerous Revelations.*** Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it's afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). If it later fails this saving throw an additional time, its previous madness effect is replaced with a new one.

***Time Is an Illusion.*** More than any other plane, time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It's even possible for them to return to Eberron *before* they left, potentially becoming stranded in another time, as discussed in the next section.

***Strange Reality.*** The things adventurers rely on--gravity, time, their identity itself--aren't always reliable in Xoriat. When characters enter a new layer, the DM can choose a property from the Properties of Xoriat table. This property could apply the entire time the adventurers are on that layer, or it could change when combat begins, whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, or at any other time the DM chooses. There are no saving throws against these effects, and an effect impacts all creatures in the layer until the DM replaces that property with a new one. In describing a property, don't just describe the effect, but explain how it manifests. *Haste* and *slow* reflect a shift in the local flow of time. When creatures can *detect thoughts*, they can hear the thoughts of others flowing like music all around them, and if they concentrate on a single creature, they can translate the meaning of the melody. Each effect reflects a strange new property of reality in this layer.

#### Xoriat and the Maze of Reality

There's a logic to the structure of the planes. Irian is the beginning, where new seeds are born. Mabar is the end, consuming all things. Time sometimes moves at different rates in different planes, but it always moves forward... except in Xoriat.

Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn't tell you what will happen, because that hasn't been decided yet. It's a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at "Queen Aurala is assassinated" and then turn right at "Breland becomes a democracy," you'll reach "Sul Khatesh is released from her prison." The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire--a map to the many possibilities of the future.

But Xoriat isn't bound to the rat. It hovers above the maze. And adventurers could return to the wrong time when they leave it, falling farther back in the maze. They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. Perhaps they help Halas Tarkanan win the War of the Mark; the dragonmarked houses are broken and scattered before they ever achieve their current glory, and people with aberrant dragonmarks thrive. With these changes, modern Khorvaire would be a very different place. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat's crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there--forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it's possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change--but it's always possible to restore a forgotten past.

This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It's possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world, as described in the section on Kythri. The gith lived on a world that was once the Prime Material Plane. Now it may just be another rat lost and forgotten in the maze. Should the daelkyr rise and complete their work, it's possible the current Eberron could be torn away from the planes; it would still exist, but as a forgotten shadow of the new central reality that takes its place.

If this doesn't entirely make sense, that's appropriate. Most scholars in Khorvaire would call this theory madness, and so Xoriat receives its name. But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. Irian is the beginning, Mabar is the end--and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn't bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn't entirely build reality, but rather, they *sculpted* it--chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.

This is a metaphysical discussion that most adventurers will never need to worry about. There are three things to take away from it. Xoriat is a point from which history and reality itself can be changed. The daelkyr have changed it an unknown number of times. And from Xoriat, it's possible for adventurers to either change it themselves--or to undo damage they might have done.

### Denizens

In Xoriat, there are masses of swirling colors, hues never seen on Eberron. There are ripples in space that disrupt time in their wake. There are bursts of powerful emotion that drift across layers. These may well be alive in some way--but there's no way to communicate with them. This section discusses some of the creatures most relevant to adventurers. While the plane might hold other forces that could be considered alive, their thought processes would almost certainly be fundamentally inhuman, and they wouldn't recognize organic beings as life.

#### The Daelkyr

The daelkyr came to Eberron to corrupt it and transform its people, and they crippled the Dhakaani Empire before being bound in Khyber. Six are known by name, but there are surely others. They remain trapped in Khyber to this day, waiting for the chance to rise and finish the work they began... and perhaps to pave the way for a new reality.

There are no known accounts of mortals traveling to Xoriat--at least, none who returned--so adventurers who do so are likely undertaking a historic journey. And in that journey, they may make a shocking discovery--though the daelkyr may be bound in Khyber, they are also *still in Xoriat*. Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra--each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat's uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven't left yet, or they might've already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down--but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can't return to Eberron now, because they're already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they're also watching it all unfold from above. So adventurers could interact with any of the daelkyr in Xoriat, but fighting them there won't impact their actions on Eberron. However, it could help adventurers learn about the weaknesses of the daelkyr, or perhaps obtain tools or weapons to use against them in the future.

#### Aberrations

The natural inhabitants of the plane are often so alien that mortals don't even recognize them as living things. Most of the aberrations that people are familiar with on Eberron aren't creations of Xoriat itself. Rather, the daelkyr, powers designed to interact with the Material Plane and its with mortals, created these aberrations as their servants, soldiers, and mementos of past conquests. In Eberron, most daelkyr have mixed forces; mind flayers could be found serving any of the great lords. In Xoriat, they're more segregated; beholders dwell in the domain of Belashyrra, and mind flayers in the realm of Dyrrn.

What other terrors do the daelkyr have in Xoriat that they've never unleashed in Eberron? This depends in part on how many other realities the daelkyr have transformed; the mind flayers are relics of the destruction of the gith, just as the dolgrims and dolgaunts are souvenirs of the downfall of Dhakaan.

While aberrations created by the daelkyr are usually dangerous, there are also aberrations generated by the layers themselves. These planar creatures are alien and disturbing, but aren't threatening unless provoked. The Native Aberrations table presents a few examples.

#### Powers of the Void

The daelkyr aren't the most powerful forces in Xoriat. There are greater powers in the void, spirits so vast and alien that they can only be perceived by the ripples they create in reality. Both the Unseen Citadel and Belashyrra are ideas in the mind of something greater. Do these powers slumber? Do they consciously adjust the rules of their layers? Or are they simply ideas cast aside by the Progenitors, models of reality that were ultimately abandoned? If Xoriat is the realm of discarded concepts, this could be the drive behind the daelkyr's endless quest to disfigure--or perfect--reality.

### Layers

Xoriat is a void lacking not only matter, but also space and time, and a mortal creature that enters it effectively ceases to exist. But there are powers in this void, and the layers of Xoriat reflect their thoughts. Each of the daelkyr dwells in a layer, the place that spawned that daelkyr; this layer usually reflects the daelkyr in tone, and it can use its lair actions anywhere in its layer. However, not all of Xoriat's layers can support mortal life; there's a layer where intense gravity crushes any physical creature, and a layer where all matter is transformed into pure thought.

Adventurers need to find portals to move from layer to layer. Portals are unique based on the layer's properties of each layer, and using a portal always has a price. Sometimes the price is paid in memories; the DM sets the emotional tone of the memory ( joy, sorrow, anger), then each player describes the memory their character has lost. With other portals, the price may be knowledge, but this isn't taken from the adventurers--rather, when they pass through the portal, they learn a secret they might have rather not known.

In exploring the layers of Xoriat, it's important to highlight the fundamentally unnatural flavor of the plane. In addition to the Properties of Xoriat table provided earlier with shifting effects that have an impact on gameplay, the Alien Attributes of Xoriat table presents examples of cosmetic details that can be distinctive features of a layer. Beyond that, the layers of Xoriat contain revelations; these can be truths about the adventurers that they don't want to know, or secrets about reality itself. This is discussed in more detail in the section on Xorian Artifacts.

#### The Unseen Citadel

This is the stronghold and birthplace of the daelkyr Belashyrra. The Lord of Eyes imagined the beholders and brought that vision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin. Tiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like creatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. The true beholders are mostly focused in deep contemplation of specific things, and don't pay attention to outsiders unless they're disturbed. Some study strange paintings. Others watch scrying pools reflecting images of Eberron or other planes. And some examine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key, a dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few that patrol the Citadel, watchful for intruders.The surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent material that your eyes can't quite focus on, as if the walls and floor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls. Some run slow and show you younger than they are; others show glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you don't want to know--current events on Eberron, scenes from the past, or the possible future.

#### The Fields of Thought

This layer is the domain of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Purple fields are bathed in ultraviolet light, and fluorescent sculptures shed eerie dim light. Varr farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate are emotions; anyone walking through a field feels a powerful emotion (fear, sorrow, anger, guilt) washing over them. Each field has an outpost containing an elder brain, with a bright line of thought transmitting the emotions to Dyrrn's tower at the heart of the layer.

Dyrrn's tower is made of glowing threads of pure thought intertwined around a massive steel spinal column. This tower is filled with the tools of fleshcrafting. There are pools of blood and canals of amniotic fluid, massive pulsing organs waiting for a purpose, and untended tendrils crawling across the floor. Adventurers might find a chamber that contains half-formed clones of the adventurers themselves... or perhaps the clones are completed, and consider the adventurers to be evil doppelgangers.

The spire amplifles Dyrrn's telepathic abilities, letting it sense all living creatures within the layer. Dyrrn specializes in corruption, and it may challenge adventurers with mental projections, such as people plucked from their memories, who seek to turn them against their allies.

#### Other Layers

Every daelkyr has a home layer, but there are endless layers of Xoriat, each reflecting a discarded idea or a maddening truth. Consider the following examples.

***A House Built from Hate.*** Each character sees the house's form slightly differently, but they all *feel* the hate in the walls. Mirrors reflect images of things the viewer hates, and books in the house chronicle the hateful deeds committed by everyone the adventurers know--including each other. The longer the adventurers stay in the houses, the easier it becomes to hate each other... or themselves.

***Empty White Space.*** There's seemingly no end to this endless void of bleak solitude. To proceed, the characters must act out their travel--pretending to travel just as they pretend there is meaning in their lives. If they can keep up the charade, the world they imagine will take shape around them.

***A Lush Orchard.*** The trees grow secrets, while more buzz around in the air like tiny birds. Some of them may be secrets of the adventurers, or those of their enemies. Others are secrets of strangers and secrets about reality. Do the adventurers block their ears, or do they try to listen?

### Planar Manifestations

The seals of the Gatekeepers block travel to Xoriat, but there are still many ways the Realm of Madness can affect the world.

#### Manifest Zones

Manifest zones tied to Xoriat are common in the Shadow Marches, but rare elsewhere. The effects of a Xorian manifest zone are rarely as dramatic as the alien attributes of the plane itself. However, manifest zones may convey one or more of the universal properties of the plane. The most common is the Dangerous Revelations property. People who linger in a Xorian zone often find alien concepts creeping into their brains, instilling strange beliefs, or twisting their sense of reality. These zones can easily produce cults of the Dragon Below; in the Shadow Marches, the Gatekeepers struggle to keep people out of these zones, while Marcher cultists consider them to be sacred sites.

Unpredictable Magic is another common property; such zones often have unnatural flora or fauna, but these effects are unreliable and change with each generation. The properties of Time Is an Illusion and Strange Reality are rare in manifest zones, and may not be active all the time; these effects might only become active when Lharvion is full, or when disturbing rituals are performed.

#### Coterminous and Remote

The last time Xoriat was coterminous, the daelkyr brought their armies through the walls of reality and laid waste to the Empire of Dhakaan. The seals crafted long ago by the Gatekeeper druids keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber, but they also keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous. Xoriat's remote phases have no known effect, and like Kythri, they're unpredictable, though the phases tend to come and go far more slowly than Kythri's do. There are no recorded instances of citizens of the Five Nations visiting Xoriat; most scholars believe that the Gatekeeper seals prevent all planar travel... though someone may have secretly built an eldritch machine in a manifest zone, perhaps incorporating illithid brains or the position of the moon Lharvion. What would happen if the adventurers stumbled on a cult of the Dragon Below just as the cult completes its sinister rituals?

#### Xorian Artifacts

The most common artifacts of Xoriat are the symbiont items created by the daelkyr. Examples of these living items can be found in chapter 7 of this book, as well as in chapter 5 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. However, adventurers could stumble on artifacts brought to Eberron by the daelkyr in their great incursion--or relics even more ancient. One effect of Xorian items could be to twist time. On a minor level, this could explain the powers of a cloak of displacement; it always shows you a few seconds ahead of your current position. A more powerful artifact could allow travel through time, or reset time in a small region. Does the time tunnel allow a return trip, or are those who use it trapped on the other side?

Xoriat is also known for granting maddening knowledge and physical transformation. Either of these effects could be reflected by supernatural gifts, as presented in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Here are a few examples:

- The character's blood is replaced with a sentient protoplasm that whispers to them while they sleep. It grants the benefits of a blessing of wound closure.
- The character gains the blessing of understanding, but they also learn that any time they cast a spell, something dies. When they cast a cantrip, it might be a rodent or a bird. The more powerful the spell, the more significant the death. The caster will likely never see this effect occur, but they know that someone somewhere is paying the price for their magic... and worse, this might be true of all spellcasters.
- The character gains the blessing of Valhalla. The spirit warriors it summons are friends of the caster, plucked from the future; the character may not have met all of them yet, but they're people who the character knows or will know. They're returned to the future in an hour or when they drop to 0 hit points... in which case they may die upon being returned to their own time.

### Xorian Stories

The seals of the Gatekeepers make Xoriat one of the more difficult planes for adventurers to reach. However, a trip to Xoriat would be a revelatory adventure. Interactions with the denizens of Xoriat are largely limited to the cults of the Dragon Below and the servants of the daelkyr. However, there are a few ways the plane could spawn adventures.

***Planar Patron.*** A warlock with a Great Old One patron could say that their patron isn't simply a daelkyr; rather, it's one of the Powers of the Void within Xoriat itself. Such contact is unprecedented--what is the nature of this connection? It may be that the Power doesn't converse with the warlock, but rather downloads knowledge directly into its mind. A disturbing possibility is that the warlock isn't supposed to be receiving this information; the knowledge stream could be intended for a powerful mind flayer, but the warlock has become linked to this psychic channel. This could provide information about the plans of the illithid's cult, but can the warlock do anything about it?

***A Glimpse of the Future.*** When the adventurers interfere with a ritual of a cult of the Dragon Below, they find themselves three years in the future... and something has gone terribly wrong. Perhaps the Mourning has spread and consumed Breland. Maybe the overlord Sul Khatesh has broken her bonds; under her rule, the warlock-knights of Aundair are conquering the Five Nations. The adventurers must find a way back to their own time--after they learn how to keep this future from coming to pass.

***Whispers in the Woods.*** While the adventurers are in a Xorian manifest zone fighting a cult of the Dragon Below, one of the characters receives a revelation: *Merrix d'Cannith will destroy the world in two years.* Does it provide any additional information or just this one absolute fact? The character knowsthat this is the truth... but is this an actual glimpse of the future, or is it luring the character down a dark path?

>>The dwarf muttered to himself as he scaled the imposing cliff. "'It's the plane of nature, Rusty!' 'It'll be a vacation, Rusty!' Well, this is the worst vacation I evaaaaaaaa--"
>>
>>Dela was already drawing her wand even as her companion began to fall. Her fingers tightened around Rev's shoulder plating as she considered her options. Rusty was tied to the warforged, but his full weight on the rope could dislodge Rev and send them all tumbling down. In her mind, she pictured the threads of gravity pulling the dwarf down, then reshaped the pattern with her thoughts, weaving the threads into a malleable platform.
>>
>>"--aaaaoOOF!" Impact with the disk knocked the wind out of Rusty, but he wasn't seriously injured. Dela rotated her wand, reeling in the threads of gravity and pulling the platform toward her. He sat up, glancing around. "Well, this is an improvement. Couldn't you have done this earlier? Saved my shoulders?"
>>
>>"I didn't want to waste the energy," Dela said, struggling to maintain her concentration.
>>
>>"Why not? Don't you think we've done enough climbing for a day? Or a lifetime?"
>>
>>Rev finally reached the top of the cliff. Digging his steel fingers into the soil, he pulled himself, Dela, and Gentle onto the plateau. Dela looked around... and then looked up. The plateau was dominated by a single massive tree--an oak taller than any of the towers of Sharn. Dela could see an airship nestled in the branches, like a child's discarded toy. It was the Storm's End. And they needed to reach it.

Adventurers in Eberron can come from the depths of the oceans, the four corners of the world, and the planes beyond it. While exploring Eberron, you might lay claim to a Dhakaani artifact or bond with a daelkyr symbiont. This chapter provides unique options for player characters, designed to reflect the rich lore, diverse races, and vibrant cultures of Eberron.

## Backgrounds

This section provides background options for changelings, Dhakaani goblinoids, and malenti, reflecting the unique heritage of these races.

- Changeling Traveler
- Dhakaani Goblinoid
- Malenti

## Races

Heroes can emerge from any corner of the world. This section provides races and subraces that reflect many unique races and cultures of Eberron: aasimar tied to Eberron's planes and religions; the elves of Aerenal; the dar of the Kech Dhakaan; the gnolls of the Znir Pact, and the ruinbound dwarves that have recently appeared in the Mror Holds. If your DM allows it, you can play one of these racial options.

- Aasimar (Court)
- Aasimar (Seeker)
- Aasimar (Scourge Variant; Fernian)
- Aasimar (Fallen Variant; Mabaran)
- Elf (Aereni)
- Dwarf (Ruinbound)
- Hobgoblin (Dhakaani Ghaal'dar)
- Goblin (Dhakaani Golin'dar)
- Bugbear (Dhakaani Guul'dar)
- Gnoll

## Racial Feats

These feats reflect cultural traditions and unique capabilities tied to the races discussed in chapter 2. These feats can be used with the optional Feats rule from chapter 6 of the *Player's Handbook*. Each feat is associated with a particular race, as summarized in the Racial Feats table. For example, the Changeling Metamorphosis feat builds on a changeling's innate shapeshifting ability, so a human can't benefit from it.

##### Racial Feats
| Race         | Feat                     |
| Changeling   | Changeling Metamorphosis |
| Changeling   | Focused Personas         |
| Elf (Aereni) | Aereni Halflife          |
| Kalashtar    | Quori Bond               |
| Kalashtar    | Thoughtsinger            |
| Shifter      | Superior Shifting        |
| Warforged    | Envoy Specialist         |
| Warforged    | Juggernaut Plating       |

## Class Options

![Artist: Storn Cook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/214%20storn%20cook.png)

This section presents four archetypes for classes found in the *Player's Handbook*, as well as two artificer specialists and a variety of artificer infusions for use with *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. These subclasses highlight the vibrant cultures and unique races of Eberron. Some of the world's most eccentric and brilliant innovators are Maverick artificers, pushing the boundaries of science and magic. The ancient traditions of renowned Dhakaani daashor live on in the Forge Adept artificers of today. The College of the Dirge Singer reflects the wisdom and brilliant leadership that Dhakaani duur'kala offer in both war and peace. The kalashtar's psychic powers are honed in the Mind domain cleric. The Circle of the Forged allows a warforged druid to become a beast of steel. And the Living Weapon's monastic tradition can be followed by warforged, shifter, changeling, or kalashtar--reflecting each race's unique potential to harness their natural gifts.

While most of these subclasses were developed with certain races in mind, they certainly aren't limited to them. If there's a compelling story--a Vadalis supersoldier magebred to become a Living Weapon, a Cannith heir using Circle of the Forged to represent a strange form of warforged lycanthropy--characters of any ancestry can make use of these subclasses.

##### Subclasses
| Class     | Subclass                    | Level Available |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Artificer | Forge Adept                 | 3rd             |
| Artificer | Maverick                    | 3rd             |
| Bard      | College of the Dirge Singer | 3rd             |
| Cleric    | Mind Domain                 | 1st             |
| Druid     | Circle of the Forged        | 2nd             |
| Monk      | Way of the Living Weapon    | 3rd             |

>>What is it?" Ban asked, carefully studying the ancient gauntlet. Pulling out her duster, Dela passed the wand over the relic. Centuries of grime vanished, revealing blackened steel and glittering Khyber dragon-shards. "The Hand of Halas Tarkanan. It's a weapon made to amplify the power of aberrant dragonmarks." She touched one of the embedded shards. "This gauntlet once leveled the towers of Sharn. And in the wrong hands, it could do so again."

Magic is an important part of everyday life in Eberron. Magic items aren't simply treasures or relics of a forgotten age; they're modern-day tools of industry and weapons of war. This section presents a range of magic items and other treasures, from the focus items of the dragonmarked houses to the living symbionts of the daelkyr. See the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for the rules on using magic items.

## Common Magic Items

Magic is used in a multitude of minor ways that may have little impact on adventurers, but improve everyday life for common folk. *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* and *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* present a number of common magic items, all of which can be found in Khorvaire. This section adds a number of additional items, but these are just the tip of the iceberg. Use these as a source of inspiration for what can be done, not as an absolute list of the only magic items found in Eberron.

Cantrips are a source of inspiration for common magic items, though most only replicate a portion of a cantrip's effects. Consider *clothes of mending*, which automatically mend themselves. The *cleansing stone*, *duster*, and *armor of gleaming* all employ the cleaning aspect of *prestidigitation*, while the *talking wand* provides the voice amplification effect of *thaumaturgy*. Cleaning, heating, chilling, mending, creating illusory sounds or images--all are tools in the Cannith arsenal.

While most common magic items have no impact on combat, a few items have practical value. The *battle rod* and *war staff* increase the range of cantrips, while the *armblade* and *integrated tool* provide minor benefits for warforged characters. As a DM, you can choose to combine a common magic item's benefits with a more powerful magic item. For example, the extended range of a common *war staff* could be applied to a *staff of fire*, or a warforged *armblade* could wield a *sun blade*.

> ##### Warforged and Prosthetic Limbs
>
>*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* introduces the *prosthetic limb*, a common magic item requiring attunement which predates the warforged. Prosthetic limbs come in many forms; one might resemble an organic limb of animated wood, and another could be a metal shell or a construct of force. During the Last War, Karrnath made use of skeletal prosthetics, and more recently, Cannith and Jorasco have produced prosthetics that use the same semiorganic materials as the warforged.
>
>*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* also includes two magic items designed to integrate into a warforged's forearm: the *armblade* and the *wand sheath*. At the DM's discretion, a character of a different race might be able to integrate one of these warforged items into their prosthetic limb; the question is if the two can logically work together, or if the style of your prosthetic makes it implausible that it could mesh with a warforged component. If the DM decides it's possible to integrate a component item with the prosthetic, the two could be counted as a single magic item for purpose of determining the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the component from the prosthetic, you immediately lose your attunement to the component.

- *Charlatan's Gloves*

- *Duster*

- *Talking Wand*
- *Thurimbar Rod*

## Dhakaani Magic Items

Though the Empire of Dhakaan has no tradition of arcane artillery, the sages of the Kech Volaar are carefully studying the tools and techniques of the Five Nations, working to grasp the principles of the evoker and the conjurer. But while wands and siege staffs aren't yet part of the Dhakaani arsenal, their daashor artificers are exceptionally talented. The Dhakaani have mastered techniques of metallurgy and smithing that Cannith has yet to learn. They know techniques for refining and working adamantine alloys and other exotic metals, and for binding arcane energies into their creations. In ancient times, the empire produced many mighty artifacts. DMs will have to decide whether the present-day Dhakaani still have the ability to craft new artifacts, or if their greatest secrets were lost in the collapse of the empire.

This section describes a few unique Dhakaani relics that might be found across Khorvaire. Typically these are found in ancient tombs and ruins; such treasures as *adamantine armor* are immune to the ravages of time. However, the Heirs of Dhakaan continue to craft fine weapons and armor, and Dhakaani champions are well equipped.

The daashor value function over fashion. Their tools and weapons are impeccably designed, but typically austere in form: blackened adamantine or steel, with emblems of clan and empire woven unobtrusively into the design. In addition to adamantine weapons, Dhakaani may produce any sort of magical arms or armor. *Armor of invulnerability*, *armor of resistance*, *defender weapons*, *mace of terror*--any of these could be Dhakaani designs. While the Dhakaani use swords, bows, and spears, their champions often field flails, maces, and mauls. Other Dhakaani magic items are usually focused on battlefield use. For example, magical banners or instruments could inspire allies or instill fear in enemies.

The Heirs of Dhakaan seek to recover Dhakaani artifacts and legendary items, and they'll try to claim these most valuable items from other creatures through force or diplomacy. While it may disturb a warrior of Dhakaan to see a human wearing Dhakaani armor or carrying an adamantine blade from an imperial forge, they don't need to recover every relic of the past, and they may allow this to pass without incident.

>The chot'uul monks, who guard the dreams of Dhakaan, craft objects that are drawn to Dal Quor with a dreamer. When you dream, your kra'uul objects accompany you. The physical object remains with your body in Eberron, but the idea of it travels with you and you can use it while exploring Dal Quor.
>
>Any kra'uul made of an otherwise-mundane object is a common magic item. Kra'uul made of other magic items are the same rarity as the standard version. While the techniques of crafting kra'uul objects are known only to the chot'uul, the DM can introduce other dreambound objects. A cursed sword might follow its bearer even into dreams, while a powerful artifact could be even more glorious when seen in Dal Quor.

## Dragonmarks

*Eberron: Rising from the Last War* includes variant races for dragonmarked characters, along with unique dragonmark focus items that can only be used by creatures with a specific dragonmark. This section provides more dragonmark focuses, as well as rules for granting powerful Siberys dragonmarks.

### Dragonmark Focus Items

Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it's easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren't overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases--such as the *storm spires* of House Lyrandar and the *creation forges* of House Cannith--the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.

This chapter provides several new dragonmark focus items. In addition, you could have a dragonmark focus item that produces the same effect as an existing magic item from the *Dungeon Master's Guide*--except it can't be used or attuned unless you possess a particular dragonmark. House Lyrandar is working on a version of a *broom of flying* for dragonmarked heirs, though they haven't perfected it yet. House Ghallanda is developing a *portable inn*--a version of the *instant fortress*--but it's proven difficult. It's always up to the DM to decide if there's a dragonmark focus item that replicates the effects of any given magic item, and if so, how readily it's available.

The Dragonmark Focus Items table provides examples of focus items, along with the item whose effects they reproduce and the mark required to use or attune to the focus item. A focus item's rarity is generally less than a similar item that anyone can use, reflecting the relative ease of manufacture. However, this doesn't mean they are readily available; dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear *Medi spectacles*, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold.

While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item, and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form. With that said, a focus item's design can differ from the usual magic item's form--the *serpentine mirror* has a similar effect to a *crystal ball*, but it's a flat mirror as opposed to an orb.

### Siberys Dragonmarks

![Artist: Lee Moyer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/227%20lee%20moyer.png)

The thirteen true dragonmarks are tied to bloodlines. By the rules provided in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*, a dragonmark must be selected during character creation. A dragonmark provides a basic set of abilities, gives you access to that subrace's or variant race's Spells of the Mark feature if you are a spellcaster, and allows you to make use of dragonmark focus items associated with your mark.

Rarely, a dragonmarked character develops power that surpasses that of other dragonmarked heirs--a fighter with the Mark of Passage could teleport even though they have no other spellcasting ability, and a Ghallanda innkeeper could summon a magnificent mansion. These rarest and most powerful of dragonmarks are known as Siberys dragonmarks. They are larger and have a far more complex pattern than do other dragonmarks. Typically, a Siberys dragonmark evolves from an existing mark, following a dire situation in which the bearer performs a remarkable feat related to the abilities of their developing mark. However, on even rarer occasion, someone spontaneously manifests a massive, powerful dragonmark despite having never possessed a lesser one.

Regardless of whether they manifest on a dragonmarked heir or an unknown foundling, the dragonmarked houses value heirs with Siberys dragonmarks. A character who displays such a mark is treated with more respect by other members of the house, but the barons and seneschals may also place greater demands on them. So a Siberys dragonmark is a blessing, but it can also be a burden. The manifestation of a Siberys dragonmark--especially one appearing spontaneously on an unmarked character--can be a sign that the bearer has an important role in the Draconic Prophecy, as well as a warning that dragons, fiends, and other powerful forces may try to manipulate or harm the character.

The evolution of a dragonmark could be represented by the existing rules for the Spells of the Mark. At the discretion of the DM and player, a dragonmarked character who has the ability to cast a 5th-level Spell of the Mark could be described as possessing a Siberys dragonmark. Similarly, a dragonmark's progression can also be represented by linking class features to your mark; for example, a rogue with the Mark of Shadow could describe their use of Evasion as a cloak of shadows summoned through the dragonmark. Either of these approaches could reflect a growth in the power of the mark, depending on the story you want to tell and the abilities you want your marked character to possess.

This section presents rules for developing Siberys dragonmarks as supernatural gifts. Chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* explains the rules for these supernatural gifts, which allow characters to receive rewards of blessings instead of treasure. This allows DMs to depict the sudden development of a dragonmark, or the unexpected growth of an existing one, in the middle of a campaign as best suits the story. Using these rules, the manifestation of a Siberys dragonmark can take a player as much by surprise as it would their character, instead of being tied to certain character levels, feats, or spellcasting ability.

#### Siberys Dragonmarks on Marked Characters

For a character that already possesses a true dragonmark (using a dragonmarked subrace or variant race from *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*), the DM can award them the supernatural gift of an evolving Siberys dragonmark. Characters can only develop the Siberys dragonmark associated with their existing mark; if they are a human with the Mark of Passage, they can't develop the Siberys Mark of Making. Previously dragonmarked characters that develop a Siberys dragonmark gain the benefits associated with the corresponding mark:

> ##### Siberys Dragonmarks vs. Greater Dragonmarks
>
>Previous editions of the game applied different rules to greater dragonmarks (which developed on characters who already possessed a lesser form of that dragonmark) and Siberys dragonmarks (which unexpectedly developed on characters that were previously unmarked). A character's development of these powerful dragonmarks was reflected by a mix of feats and prestige classes which could only be taken at certain levels; as a result, players often felt it necessary to carefully plan out their mark's progression at character creation for fear of missing out on key abilities.
>
>However, both of these  marks share a central story, the rare evolution of an immensely powerful dragonmark. *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* streamlined the rules for dragonmarks into a single point of entry, a subrace or variant race chosen during character creation. Similarly, this chapter combines the mechanics for greater and Siberys dragonmarks into a single supernatural gift, granting the Spells of the Mark that lesser heirs possess along with greater powers.
>
>If it better suits your story, you could choose to take the approach of previous editions; a previously unmarked character could manifest a Siberys mark that only grants a singular high-level spell (without granting the lower-level spells of other marked characters). But by default, the rules in this book give the same abilities to all characters that develop advanced dragonmarks, regardless of whether they were marked previously.

- Siberys Dragonmark of Detection
- Siberys Dragonmark of Finding
- Siberys Dragonmark of Handling
- Siberys Dragonmark of Healing
- Siberys Dragonmark of Hospitality
- Siberys Dragonmark of Making
- Siberys Dragonmark of Passage
- Siberys Dragonmark of Scribing
- Siberys Dragonmark of Sentinel
- Siberys Dragonmark of Shadow
- Siberys Dragonmark of Storm
- Siberys Dragonmark of Warding

#### Siberys Dragonmarks on Unmarked Characters

On rare occasion, a character that doesn't bear a dragonmark can spontaneously develop a Siberys dragonmark. These characters must be of the same base race as the other bearers of that dragonmark, as established by the subrace or variant race for that dragonmark from *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. So, for example, only a dwarf can manifest a Siberys Mark of Warding. All Siberys-marked characters have blood ties to the dragonmarked house that bears that mark, though they might not have known about the connection until the mark manifests. Dragonmarked houses usually try to recruit these characters, recognizing their immense value as envoys and agents.

If a DM chose to tell a different story, they might break this rule and grant a Siberys mark to a character of a different species (such as granting a Mark of Warding to a changeling character). This would be an unprecedented historic event, and the house that bears the mark could consider the character an abomination and a threat.

Previously unmarked characters that develop a Siberys dragonmark gain the following benefits:

- **Siberys Dragonmark Features.** The mark grants the same powers as the Siberys dragonmark does on previously marked characters, as described in the previous section.
- **Dragonmark Focus Items.** The character can attune to and use any magic items that require a creature bear that particular dragonmark; for example, a character with a Siberys Mark of Detection can use *Medi spectacles*, but not *Kundar chains*.
- **Spells of the Mark.** If the character has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Spells of the Mark table for the corresponding dragonmarked subrace or variant race in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* are added to the spell list of their spellcasting class. However, the character doesn't gain any of the other racial features usually associated with their dragonmark's subrace or variant race.

> ##### Variant Rule: Alternate Acquisition of Siberys Marks
>
>This book uses the rules for supernatural gifts due to their flexibility, letting the DM tell a compelling story of a powerful dragonmark that manifests unexpectedly during a campaign. However, some DMs may wish to make Siberys dragonmarks available for players to select in more traditional ways. For example, some games use the Shared Campaign rules in Appendix A of *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, in which players earn "treasure points" they can use to select their own story rewards as the game progresses, rather than receiving DM-selected story rewards such as magic items or supernatural gifts. This sidebar contains suggestions on how to integrate Siberys dragonmarks into a game where the DM does not wish to use supernatural gifts.
>
>***Ability Score Improvement.*** The Siberys dragonmarks presented in this section are significantly more powerful than an Ability Score Improvement or a feat (which characters can take as early as 4th level) and should not be allowed for first or second tier characters. However, as a variant rule, a DM could choose to allow characters of 12th level or above to take a Siberys dragonmark instead of an Ability Score Improvement.

>***Magic Items.*** Under Shared Campaign rules, players obtain magic items by spending treasure points based on the value of the item they are acquiring. If a DM chooses, they could allow players to "purchase" a Siberys dragonmark as if it were a magic item found on Magic Item Table G.

## Miscellaneous Magic Items

This section presents a few items that use magic readily accessible to the skilled artificers of Eberron. The Aereni mask would generally only be crafted on the island of Aerenal, and only given to worthy Aereni elves. The rest might be purchased in the major cities of Khorvaire, though they might have limited quantities or require you to find an artificer willing to take a special commission.

- *Aereni Mask*
- *Final Messenger*
- *Gloves of Storing*
- *Soarsled*
- *Tools of the Master*

## Symbionts

The daelkyr create living tools and weapons, objects formed from chitin, bone, and muscle. Many of these items bond to their bearer, drawing sustenance from the creature attuned to them; for this reason, they are commonly called "symbionts." Though symbionts are living tools, they are mechanically considered a magic item, not a creature.

This section introduces eight new symbiont items, like those in chapter 5 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*. In addition, you could present any existing magic item as a daelkyr-made symbiont by describing the item as being made from organic materials. A *dagger of venom* crafted by Valaara could be a chitin blade that's warm to the touch. A *cloak of the bat* might feel like membranous leather, with veins running through the material. A *periapt of wound closure* could be a scarab that burrows into the flesh of the bearer, enhancing their blood. Even common magic items can be symbionts; an *everbright lantern* could be a sluglike creature with a luminescent body.

When presenting an existing item as a symbiont, the DM must decide whether to add the Symbiotic Nature feature that other symbionts have. When such an item is attuned, it can't be removed from the bearer, even if they desire it; the only way to end the attunement and remove a symbiont is to use an effect that ends a curse. This prevents the item from being taken away, but limits a character's free will, so it's up to the story you want to tell. While Symbiotic Nature is a common attribute for symbionts, it's not a requirement. A slug that functions as an *everbright lantern* wouldn't require attunement. Even if the *periapt of wound closure* is a scarab that digs into the flesh of the bearer, perhaps it could be pried loose, or it might release its grip voluntarily if the bearer ends the attunement.

- *Crawling Gauntlet*
- *Coat of Many Eyes*
- *Hungry Weapon*
- *Shadow Sibling*
- *Spellburrow*
- *Throwing Scarab*
- *Tongueworm*
- *Wandering Eye*

## Daelkyr

A daelkyr knows secrets mortals can't comprehend and has plans they can't understand. Some sages believe that the daelkyr are artists and that worlds are their canvas; they destroy civilizations and unleash monsters because, to them, this is a thing of beauty. Others say that the daelkyr exist beyond time, and that their actions only make sense when viewed over the course of millennia. Still others assert that any creature that can understand the motives of the daelkyr will immediately turn to their cause--that it is dangerous to study the daelkyr too closely, lest their revelations destroy all prior understanding and identity. While they may be enigmatic, the daelkyr are unquestionably evil; they shatter innocent lives and entire civilizations without any remorse.

***Unifying Theme..*** Each daelkyr has a unique theme; Belashyrra is tied to sight. Valaara to insects, and Dyrrn to corruption and evolution. This theme is reflected in the daelkyr's appearance, in the minions it employs, and in the symbionts it creates. If the daelkyr is an artist, the theme is its medium. If it's a conqueror, the theme defines its weapons and the world it seeks to create. Additionally, each daelkyr holds secrets and revelations relating to its specific theme--secrets mortal minds can't comprehend. While in Belashyrra's presence, people may remember things they've seen and forgotten. Around Valaara, they may feel insects burrowing through their flesh, or sense the thoughts of their allies--a momentary sensation of being part of a hive.

***Alien and Unsettling.*** In an encounter with a daelkyr, consider ways to express its alien nature, such as the following:

- A daelkyr can teleport 30 feet as a bonus action. This reflects the idea that the daelkyr are loosely bound to space and time. The daelkyr shifts in space, but you can't remember it moving. You could represent this as a constant, casual effect; even outside of combat, the daelkyr shifts between spaces, unbound by the concept of distance or time.
- The appearance of a daelkyr is subjective. The basic facts are constant: a daelkyr is a Medium bipedal creature, and its equipment doesn't change. Beyond this, its appearance reflects its theme blended with its alien nature; for example, Valaara typically appears as an angelic humanoid merged with insect elements. But after people encounter a daelkyr, those who compare notes may find they disagree on the details. The daelkyr might appear as someone the viewer knows, or its appearance could shift mid-conversation. This is not something the daelkyr controls, and it's not considered a beneficial trait; it's simply part of their alien nature.
- Daelkyr have telepathy with a range of 120 feet. This is their primary form of communication and is intended to be broader in scope than typical telepathy. A daelkyr can communicate with any number of creatures within range at once, projecting a thought much as other creatures project sound. Typically when a daelkyr "speaks," all creatures receive the same message, but the DM might decide that one or more creatures receive a different message. And just as people see different things when they look at a daelkyr, two people can perceive a daelkyr's "speech" in very different ways. One may feel as though the daelkyr is speaking aloud with a strange, alien voice. Another may hear the speech of the daelkyr as the voice of a dead lover, whispering in their ear. Another may not be able to remember actually hearing the daelkyr speak; instead, they just remember its words existing, as if they've always known them.
- The Alien Mind feature of the daelkyr reflects the idea that the way that the daelkyr experience reality is so alien that any creature who tries to read their thoughts--to see the universe as they do--may become catatonic.

Any encounter with a daelkyr should be horrifying, driven by its alien, unknowable nature. The actions of the Lords of Dust and the Dreaming Dark make sense; the quori seek to control humanity's dreams, while the Lords of Dust strive to release their bound overlords. The actions of the daelkyr are just as deadly and destructive, but we cannot understand what they want, and those who attempt to do so often become cultists.

## Fey Rulers

![Artist: Olie Boldador](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/236%20olie%20boldador.png)

The fey emanate from Thelanis. The least among them embody the magic we wish to see in the world--the idea of spirits in the trees and wind, of mischievous sprites and satyrs dancing in the glades. The greatest are the archfey, immortals of story who rule domains within Thelanis. This section presents two such rulers: the Forest Queen and the Forgotten Prince.

## Merfolk

Touched by Lamannia, the merfolk of the Thunder Sea have a deep connection to primal forces and planar power. The merfolk shepherd underwater manifest zones, and many can channel druidic magic. At the DM's discretion, merfolk encountered in the Thunder Sea could know a cantrip from the druid spell list.

- **Merfolk Stormcaller**

## Quori

![Artist: Ekaterina Yastrubetskaya](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/244%20ekaterina%20yastrubetskaya.png)

The quori are the spirits that rule Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. Quori are immortal, but they can be slain; when a quori dies, its essence returns to the Dreaming Dark, where it is reconstituted as a new spirit. Quori spirits are bound to emotions, and they feed on those emotions and excel at manipulating them in mortals. The tsucora thrive on fear, the hashalaq manipulate pleasure, the du'ulora are driven by anger, and the kalaraq consume pride and ambition. These are the most common quori, but there are many others; the spiteful tsoreva and the domineering usvapna have already been mentioned in previous editions.

The quori are the creations of il-Lashtavar, the malevolent force that shapes Dal Quor. Cruelty is a part of their nature. However, when a quori is reborn, there is a microscopic chance that it will be touched by il-Yannah, the incarnation of light that will one day replace the Dreaming Dark. It's possible for a quori to carry this seed of light and never embrace it. The kalaraq Taratai was the first to rally those quori who could sense the light, teaching them to push back the darkness and embrace il-Yannah. These rebels are the spirits who are now bound to the kalashtar. They are still quori--tsucora, hashalaq, du'ulora, kalaraq--and they are still tied to the emotion associated with their quori type. But they are driven by their vision of the light that is to come rather than the darkness of the present. Taratai's rebels fled Dal Quor long ago, and there have surely been new quori touched by il-Yannah since then. But today, the Dreaming Dark are constantly policing their own ranks and searching for such "corrupted" spirits. Any that are found will be destroyed, so their spirits can be reborn as proper servants of il-Lashtavar.

All quori have powerful psionic abilities. DMs could choose to represent this by granting each quori from *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* telepathy with a range of 120 feet. If a quori has any Inspired hosts, as do all that interact with the Material Plane, it would also speak the Riedran language.

> ##### Quori: Fiends or Aberrations?
>
>Quori aren't biological creatures. They're immortal spirits, fragments of nightmare spawned by il-Lashtavar. They don't sleep, and they dine only on the emotions of mortals. They are known for their ability to possess other mortals, a reflection of their fundamentally spiritual nature. All of these make them quite different from creatures such as beholders or mind flayers--monsters that are deeply alien, but that are still formed of flesh and blood.
>
>The choice to classify quori as aberrations in fifth edition reflects the idea that "aberration" is a broad category including any entity that is fundamentally alien; and certainly, the quori have no place in the natural world. However, this has a number of concrete mechanical effects. Many effects that target evil spirits only affect fiends and undead. As aberrations, quori can't be detected by a paladin's Divine Sense or banished to Dal Quor with *divine word*. The spells *hallow* and *forbiddance* don't protect against them. This was an intentional decision that renders quori immune to many of the tools that can be deployed against devils or demons. However, as a DM, you can choose to make quori fiends instead of aberrations if you want these spells and effects to be effective against them. Or you could compromise by leaving quori as aberrations, but say that clerics and paladins devoted to the Path of Light can affect quori with any spell or class feature that affects fiends. This keeps quori as mysterious and alien, and gives the Path of Light a unique role in battling them.

>As described in chapter 6 of *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*, an **Inspired** gain benefits based on the type of quori possessing it.

## Sahuagin

![Artist: Vincentius Matthew](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/_img/ExploringEberron/247%20vincentius%20matthew.jpg)

The sahuagin dominate the Thunder Sea. Proud and predatory, the sahuagin see the creatures of the surface world as primitive and weak. The sahuagin are generally content to ignore the lesser creatures that dwell above the water, but when there is blood in the water, they are implacable and deadly foes. Through magebreeding and induced mutation they have created a host of terrors, such as the duplicitous malenti, the four-armed barons, the shapeshifting plasmids, and the terrifying Claws of Sha'argon.

- **Plasmid**
